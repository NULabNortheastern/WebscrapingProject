Be intentional, and </span>organize your slides carefully considering how to order and structure them so that you can get your message across.</p>
<p>Be mindful of your audience, and don't make them work too hard. This means you should put your main ideas front-and-center, adding<span> any additional detail in the “Notes” section. Think about the type of presentation you would like to see.</span></p>
<p>Use signposts<span> to orient your audience. If your PowerPoint has different sections or chapters, use signpost slides to separate them. This will help your audience keep up with your argument.</span></p><script src="https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145230000000000001/attachments/22977597/dp_app%20%25282%2529.js"></script>
