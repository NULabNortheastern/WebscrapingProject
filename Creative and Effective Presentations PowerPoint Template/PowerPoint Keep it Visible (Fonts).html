<ul>
<li><span>Serif fonts have a small line tailing from the edges of letters. They were designed to be used in documents filled with lots of text. Serif fonts are said to be easier to read at small point sizes, but for on-screen presentations, the old classical serifs tend to get lost due to the relatively low resolution of projectors. However, some modern and transitional serif fonts are strong, stylish, and dynamic that may serve for both long-form texts and presentations. Common examples of serif typefaces are Times New Roman, Garamond,<span> Baskerville, Cambria, Americana, and Georgia.&nbsp;</span></span></li>
<li><span>Sans-serif fonts tend to have less stroke width variation and are often used to convey simplicity or minimalism. Their unassuming and modern look makes them well suited for technology applications.&nbsp; If you are unsure about choosing a font type, use a sans-serif font--they are generally suitable for PowerPoint presentations. Common examples of sans-serif typefaces are Helvetica, Arial, Calibri, Verdana, and Tahoma.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Regardless of what font you choose, make sure the text can be read from the back of the room (if giving an in-person presentation) or on laptop and zoom screens (if giving a virtual presentation). </span><span><strong>Use the same font set throughout your entire slide presentation, and use no more than two complementary fonts</strong> (e.g., Arial and Arial Bold).&nbsp;</span><span>Use </span><strong>bold</strong><span> for emphasis, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">u</span></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>nderline</span></span><span> and </span><i><span>italic</span></i><span> change the letter shapes, making them less identifiable - and should be avoided.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span><span>Note: The slide example above is using Cambria font, which</span><span>&nbsp;is a </span>transitional serif typeface.<span> It is very readable when printed small or displayed on a low-resolution screen and has even spacing and proportions.</span></span></p><script src="https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145230000000000001/attachments/22977597/dp_app%20%25282%2529.js"></script>
