<p><span>An easy way to achieve this is to</span><strong> get your "master" slides in place before you build content slides. </strong><span>Though this tip sounds basic, many people jump right into building their slide content. Naturally, then the position of their slide title, department logo, and text fonts vary from slide to slide–giving the slide deck an unprofessional feel.</span></p>
<p><span>You should also </span><strong>organize your content with section headers and guideposts. </strong><span>When your presentation is long, your audience loses context. It is a good idea to divide your content into logical segments and orient your audience to your presentation structure right upfront.</span></p>
<p><span>Another tip is to</span><strong> keep your images consistent on a slide. </strong><span>A simple thumb rule is–don’t mix visual types. If you want to use photos on a slide, then use just photos. Don’t get tempted to insert clipart on the same slide. If you want to use a 2D image on a slide, don’t insert a 3D image right next to it.</span></p><script src="https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145230000000000001/attachments/22977597/dp_app%20%25282%2529.js"></script>
