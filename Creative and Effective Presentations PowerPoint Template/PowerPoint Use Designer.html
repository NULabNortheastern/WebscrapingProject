<p>PowerPoint Themes <span>are design templates that contain color schemes, slide and title masters with custom formatting, and styled fonts designed for a particular "look."&nbsp;</span><strong>When you apply a design template to your presentation, the slide master and color scheme of the new template replace the slide master and color scheme of the original presentation.</strong></p>
<p><span>Just because PowerPoint has provided templates does not mean they are all good, make a choice based on the best practices shared earlier. <strong>“Simple, uncluttered, visually pleasing but also accessible to everyone” is the key!</strong></span></p>
<p><span>You can also choose to use a basic design template and create your own design.</span></p>
<p><span>Steps to choose a Theme:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Select the Design tab.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Select one of the Themes—click on the down arrow with a line over it for the drop-down menu.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Select one of the Variants.</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><span>Designer</span></h2>
<p><span><strong>PowerPoint Designer can improve slides by automatically generating design ideas to choose from.</strong> When you put content on a slide, the Designer works in the background to match that content to professionally designed layouts. You can choose to accept the layout proposed by the designer or continue making your own.</span></p>
<p><span>Steps to use the Designer:</span></p>
<p><span>Option 1: Insert one or more pictures, a list of items, or a list of dates. The </span><strong>Designer </strong><span>panel will open.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Option 2: You can also bring up Designer by selecting a picture, and then selecting </span><strong>Design </strong><span>&gt; </span><strong>Design Ideas</strong><span>.</span></p>
