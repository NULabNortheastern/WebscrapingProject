<h3>Color Theory Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><span>The warm colors on the color wheel are reds, oranges, and yellows. </span><span>On the opposite side are the cool colors: greens, blues, and violets.</span></li>
<li><span>To create complementary color combinations, you must select two colors that sit opposite each other—such as a warm color like orange and a cool color like blue.</span></li>
<li><span>Don’t be subtle with your color palette. Use bold colors and high contrast that make your text stand out clearly from the background. People with disabilities should not have problems reading the presentation.</span></li>
<li><span><span>Be careful about laying text over images—make sure the contrast is strong. Use a color contrast checker and ensure </span></span>that a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 exists between text (and images of text) and the background behind the text. For example, if a <span>wide variety of colors and shades appear in the picture, the area behind the text should be fogged white so that the picture is very faint and the maximum darkness is still light enough to maintain a 4.5:1 contrast ratio with the black text written over the picture.</span></li>
<li><span>Try to keep it simple and don’t use too many colors. In general, three to four colors are sufficient for a presentation.</span></li>
<li><span>An easy way to create a balanced presentation is to stick by the 60-30-10 rule. </span><span>This means that if you’ve chosen three colors, then you should devote 60 percent of the space on your slides to the primary color, 30 percent to the secondary, and 10 percent to the accent color.</span></li>
