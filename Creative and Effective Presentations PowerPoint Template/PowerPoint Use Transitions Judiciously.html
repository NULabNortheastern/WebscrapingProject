They can help to direct the audience's eye and combat presentation fatigue by adding visual interest, but, just like animations, the type of transition matters!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Transitions are more subtle than animations: most involve a simple effect that slows down the reveal of the next slide, like the Uncover, Push, Wipe, Fade and Reveal transitions. As with animations, <strong>transitions </strong><strong>should only be used if they improve your presentation style and improves communication of highly technical or complex information.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Transitions can be effective when highlighting or emphasizing certain slides; perhaps you want to use a Reveal transition for a slide with particular importance within the presentation. It is best not to use different transitions on every slide, as this can lead to the presentation looking less serious.</p>
<p>The Transitions pane displays all the options available in PowerPoint, and clicking an option will both preview what the transition looks like&nbsp;<em>and</em> apply it to the current slide. To remove the transition, click the "None" option on the left of the Transitions pane.</p>
<p>One transition effect that can add some sophistication to your presentation is the Morph effect. While a bit tricky to use, it's an impressive way to subtly transform objects on your slides. For example, you can highlight differences in charts or graphs by morphing one into the other, or zoom in or out of maps.</p>
<p>How to morph objects between slides:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify and position the objects that you wish to morph on consecutive slides.</li>
<li>Rename your objects.
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
<li>On macOS, on the <strong>Home</strong> tab, click <strong>Arrange&nbsp;</strong>and then choose&nbsp;<strong>Selection Pane</strong>.</li>
<li>On Windows, on the&nbsp;<strong>Home&nbsp;</strong>tab, click&nbsp;<strong>Editing</strong>, then&nbsp;<strong>Select</strong> and then choose&nbsp;<strong>Selection Pane</strong>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Select the object you want to morph from the list, and double click it to make it editable.</li>
<li>Give the object a new name, but make sure to prefix the name with !! with no spaces, e.g.&nbsp;<strong>!!Object1</strong>.</li>
<li>Go to the subsequent slide and select the second object in the morphing sequence (the one to be morphed into), and&nbsp;<strong>give it the same name</strong>. PowerPoint will not morph two objects without the same name or without the !! prefix.</li>
