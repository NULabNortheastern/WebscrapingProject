In fact,<strong> replace text with visuals wherever possible</strong>. They are a great way to communicate complex information. </span><span>The use</span><span>&nbsp;of </span>diagrams<strong> </strong><span>and other visuals is a very effective and visually attractive way to illustrate concepts and describe methods.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can add many kinds of charts to your presentation: bar charts, trend lines, pie charts, scatter plots, spider charts, and more. However, the <strong>graphics and charts should be of high-quality, accurate, and self-explanatory</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Look at the following example and think which one is better? And why? [Check the font size, color contrast, labels, readability, etc.]</span></p>
<p><span><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://northeastern.instructure.com/courses/27668/files/9401478/preview?verifier=YsD6l10bpWpD4gNHw6vYvK7AE7WLGMeeJpHpAkCG" alt="Good and Poor Chart" width="699" height="261" data-ally-user-updated-alt="Good and Poor Chart" data-api-endpoint="https://northeastern.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/27668/files/9401478" data-api-returntype="File" loading="lazy"></span></p>
<p><span>When you make charts, always ask yourself, “How much detail do I need?” Presenters often include too much data in their on-screen charts. Focus on conveying the most important data and information, and choose a chart that best suits your communication needs.</span></p>
<p>Tables<span> are good for side-by-side comparisons of data.&nbsp; However, tables can lack impact, so wherever possible use charts for quantitative data. If you choose to use a table do not forget to limit text, make content clear and visible. That said, you should&nbsp;<strong>always</strong> clearly label your charts and tables.</span></p>
<p><span>Avoid using PowerPoint Clip Art from the older versions or other cartoonish line art; instead explore icons in the newer PowerPoint versions. You can also use royalty-free vector images and illustrations from the internet.</span></p>
<p><span>Lastly,<strong> remember that a single image, illustration, photograph, chart is far more powerful than a slide cluttered with</strong> images.</span></p>
