<strong>Computational Text Analysis</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Text analysis is making inferences based on textual data. Computational text analysis (CTA) involves a computer drawing out patterns in a text, and a researcher interpreting those patterns. CTA includes methods such as word count frequency, nGrams, and sentiment analysis. CTA is similar to statistical analysis, but the data are texts.&nbsp;</span>

<strong>Corpus (plural–corpora)</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: A collection of texts used for analysis and research purposes.&nbsp;</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Stop words</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: words that appear frequently in a language, like pronouns, prepositions, and basic verbs. These are often removed for computational analysis. Some English stopwords include: a, the, she, he, I, me, us, of, is, would, could, should, etc.&nbsp;</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Word Count Frequency:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Counting the total times a word appears in a text/corpus or the percentage of how often it appears.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Sentiment Analysis</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Measuring the sentiment of a text based on a scale such as negative/positive or happy/sad. Each word has a particular weight to determine where on the scale it falls, and these weights are calculated to determine a text’s overall sentiment.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Web-Browser Computational Text Analysis Tools</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These browser-based GUI (Graphical User Interface) text analysis tools are not particularly powerful or sophisticated, but they can show word frequencies and patterns in language. While using coding languages like Python and R can open up other types of analysis (such as word embedding models and topic modeling), these GUI tools allow you to do more basic analysis to begin examining your texts computationally.&nbsp; We will be working with:</span></p>
