<p><strong>How to Build a Corpus</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When building a corpus, especially in the context of a smaller project, follow these steps:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choose the texts you would like to include in your corpus.&nbsp;</span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember, these texts are not necessarily representative of a larger body of writing, but rather a contextualized collection of texts.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In your argument and analysis, you should specifically address and analyze the contexts of these texts, and consider any possible limitations in their ability to serve as proxies for the phenomena you wish to study.</span></li>
</ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a folder on your computer or cloud storage where you will store your corpus. You might title this folder “international_relations_corpus”.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have chosen the texts you will include, open a plain text editor (for example, Notepad on PCs and TextEdit on Macs).</span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TextEdit on Macs: You must make sure it is configured to work with plain text files. To do this, open Text Edit and go to “Preferences” and make sure “plain text editor” is selected. Then, restart TextEdit.</span></li>
</ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To add the actual text, simply copy and paste the contents of each document into the text editor. Often, texts that are on websites can easily be copied and pasted. Only copy one text into each new plain text file.&nbsp;</span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some articles might have HTML/web-browser versions that will be easier to copy-and-paste than PDFs.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you cannot copy and paste the text (if it is a PDF or an image), either find a text that you can copy and paste, or transcribe the text.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure each file name ends with .txt –&nbsp;this is a plain text file and most GUI tools will accept these.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use filenames to indicate the data inside (ex: “2012obama.txt”)</span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure not to put any spaces in the names of the files as you save them. Use underscores or hyphens to mark spaces between words instead.</span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Repeat steps 4 and 5 for each text in your corpus.&nbsp; </span></li>
</ul>
