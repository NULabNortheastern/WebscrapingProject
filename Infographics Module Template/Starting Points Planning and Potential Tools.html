<h3><span>Tools</span></h3>
<p><span>There are <strong>different tools&nbsp;</strong>you may use to make an infographic. Here are some commonly used tools, and a summary of their strengths&nbsp;and weaknesses:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Infogram: </strong><span>This is a professional infographic tool with straightforward, generic icons. One of its strengths is its unique “maps” folder, where users can find a broad range of geographic icons pertaining to countries, cities, and even electoral districts.&nbsp; Likely the best tool to use for map-based infographics. </span><span><a href="https://infogram.com/" target="_blank">https://infogram.com/</a></span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Canva:</strong><span> Out of all these tools, Canva is the most user-friendly, offering a wide range of colorful and graphically varied in-built images as well as a smooth, intuitive interface. The downside of this breadth and variety is a less focused, less uniform aesthetic. Canva users might find it difficult to find icons for their graphics that “fit together.” Also, you need a paid membership to resize projects. Likely the best tool for beginners.&nbsp; </span><a href="https://www.canva.com/"><span>https://www.canva.com/</span></a></li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Piktochart:</strong><span> Like Canva, Piktochart features a particularly intuitive, user-friendly interface. Its uniform style also offers images of full-bodied characters, rather than the comparatively more generic, faceless “human” icons found in other tools. Unfortunately, Piktochart does not offer its users the ability to modify the chart and graph icons relative to actual data, making it difficult to graphically portray accurate statistics. </span><a href="https://piktochart.com/"><span>https://piktochart.com/</span></a></li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Venngage:</strong><span> This tool offers a sizable range of icons, which are simultaneously uniform in design and visually appealing. It also organizes these icons within a long list of specified topics, making it easy for users to find graphics according to their needs. </span><a href="https://infograph.venngage.com/"><span>https://infograph.venngage.com/</span></a></li>
