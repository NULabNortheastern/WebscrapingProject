<ol>
<li aria-level="1"><span><strong>Develop a defined argument</strong>: b</span><span>rainstorm what information you are looking for and what you can find.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span><strong>Think of ways to show your argument</strong>. For example, if you want to argue that people can and should reduce their household waste because Boston is running out of storage room, then you will need facts about household waste in Boston, the limited space in Boston, and maybe some interesting quotations about the issue. You can organize this set of information into an infographic.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span><strong>Collect information that supports your argument. </strong>Visit relevant websites. Explore the university's library website. If you find facts or statistics, write them down. You may want to make a graph with those statistics later.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span><strong>Think of counter arguments that opponents to your view might raise.</strong> Consider ways to address them through charts, graphs, or images. For instance, some may argue that Twitter is not actually used by people for real, everyday communication. Including the fact about marriage proposals on Twitter is one way to show a counter to the counter argument!</span></li>
