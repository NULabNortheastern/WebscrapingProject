<h2>Create a layout:</h2>
<p><span>Pick your canvas dimensions. Canva features a curated “infographic” size, but you can customize the width and length at any time with the resizing option. You can also add more “pages,” though infographics generally come as a single image.</span></p>
<p><span>Infographics work best when presenting information through one direction, so it might help to size your canvas as being long either vertically or horizontally!</span></p>

<h2>Pick a Style:</h2>
<p><span>Infographics work best when presented in a uniform style. Try to get your information and your design to work together! If you need some help or inspiration, Canva offers several infographic templates you can start from.</span></p>

<h2>Add Layers:</h2>
<p><span>Canva, like other infographic tools, works by combining several graphic layers. Layers can be anything that shows up on the canvas—elements, charts, text, etc.—and can be customized in many ways. You can drag them around, change their colors, resize them, and more!</span></p>
<p><span>Remember that you can always send a layer “forward” or “back” relative to other layers with a simple right click (or use the key commands shown below)</span></p>
