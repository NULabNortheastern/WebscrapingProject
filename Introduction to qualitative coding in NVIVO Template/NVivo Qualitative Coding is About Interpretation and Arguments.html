<p><span>You can take </span><strong>screenshots</strong><span> or save your results from queries to show your work as you’re researching, organizing, annotating, and coding your sources.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Use this documentation and query results to emphasize your argument.&nbsp;</span></p>

<li><span>For example, if you’re interested in understanding food access at Northeastern, you might look at how often your interviewee mentioned food. How is food mentioned? What are the connections between food and first-year experiences?</span></li>
</ul>
<p>You can also use NVivo to visualize your data and research in order to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">boost your arguments</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">prove your reasoning</span> for data interpretations.
