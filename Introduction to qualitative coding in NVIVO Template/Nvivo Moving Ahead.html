<p>In the sections that follow, we will revisit some vocabulary terms and show you how they function in NVivo. Each new concept has instructions for both Mac and Windows systems, so use the platform most suited to your device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we get started, refresh yourself on these terms. Feel free to return to this list at any time as you work through the module.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data</strong><span>: Information organized to be used for research. In NVivo, the data includes the files you have imported or created in the software. This can also include metadata.</span></li>
<li><strong>Codes: </strong><span>The themes, concepts, or sentiments in your research material and data. Codes in NVivo are separated into two broad categories: nodes and relationships.</span>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nodes: </strong><span>Nodes are the themes, concepts, ideas, opinions, or experiences of your data. Nodes can also be organized with tiered or ‘children’ nodes underneath ‘parent’ nodes.</span></li>
<li><strong>Relationships: </strong><span>Relationships in NVivo are a special type of code that is a connection between two data items. Relationships can be one-way (for example: someone employing someone else), associative (such as: two people knowing each other), or symmetrical (for instance: two people working together).</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cases: </strong><span>In NVivo, cases are the unit of analysis for your research. For example, if you are studying a group population, your cases would be the individuals in that group. You can assign different variables and attributes to your cases</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Memos</strong>: Memos are more extended write-ups of your analytical insights, based on what you have coded. You can think about it like a mid-point between your codes and annotations on one hand, and the actual text in the paper that you are writing on the other.</span></li>
<li><strong>Maps: </strong><span>Maps in NVivo are a useful visualization tool for seeing connections between the cases and nodes in your data.</span></li>
<li><strong>Query: </strong><span>Queries in the context of NVivo are a flexible way to explore and analyze your data and codes. With a query you can count word frequency, assign new codes based on a search, and perform searches based upon case attributes.</span></li>
