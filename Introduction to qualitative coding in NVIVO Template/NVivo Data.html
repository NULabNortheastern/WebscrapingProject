<h4><span>Important reminder</span></h4>
<p><span>NVivo can import many types of files, including .docx, .pdf, .doc, .csv, .png, .jpeg, .txt, video/audio files, and more.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You should always <strong>save</strong> your original documents on your local computer or in cloud storage, even if these documents are imported into NVivo. NVivo can store documents, but it is more of an organization and analysis tool, rather than a storage option. </span></p><script src="https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145230000000000001/attachments/22977597/dp_app%20%25282%2529.js"></script>
