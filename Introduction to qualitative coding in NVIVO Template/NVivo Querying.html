<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Word Frequency</strong><span>: Counts the number of times words (with stopwords removed) appear in one or more files</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Coding</strong><span>: Shows the number of codes, the text that was coded, and the files</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Crosstab</strong><span>: Cross-references nodes and case classifications. For example, you might want to know how often a particular node appears in both scholarly articles and your primary texts.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>You can query multiple items at once.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Let's practice querying a text.</strong></h2>
<p>In the next few slides, try out a word frequency query on your own; instructions are provided for both Windows and Mac systems. &nbsp;If you have time, experiment with the coding and cross tab query commands.&nbsp;</p><script src="https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145230000000000001/attachments/22977597/dp_app%20%25282%2529.js"></script>
