<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Mac NVivo projects end in .npvx and can only open that file project type</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Windows NVivo projects end in .npv, but can open both .npv </span><i><span>and</span></i><span> .npvx</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Version numbers (10, 11, 12) also affect which projects can be opened on which platform</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>That is why this module will have examples for most of the functions both from Mac and Windows versions. The images coming up in this module will give you a better idea of the differences between the operating systems.&nbsp;</span></p><script src="https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145230000000000001/attachments/22977597/dp_app%20%25282%2529.js"></script>
