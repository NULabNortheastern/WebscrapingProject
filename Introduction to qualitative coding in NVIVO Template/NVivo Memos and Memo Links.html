More specifically, you can use memos to records your observations, insights, failures, and persisting questions and concerns in greater detail. <strong>Memos are a great starting point to begin drafting the preliminary and final versions of your research paper.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>You can think about it like a mid-point between your codes and annotations on the one hand, and the actual text in the paper that you are writing.&nbsp;</strong></span><span>Because memos are typically more long-form documentation than annotations and other comments, they have some unique features:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>They can stand alone, but can also be linked to a particular file, case, or node</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Memos can be created for specific sources, codes, or as standalone pieces of reflection and documentation</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What can you do within a memo?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Add and edit text (type directly into the memo)</span></li>
<li><span>Insert tables, media, and other useful symbols&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Insert annotations&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Add codes within your memo&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Note: you can import your&nbsp;writing from other note-taking tools (like Evernote) and reference management&nbsp;software (like EndNote, RefWorks, and Zotero). NVivo will create memos automatically whenever you choose to import this data.&nbsp;</span></p>
