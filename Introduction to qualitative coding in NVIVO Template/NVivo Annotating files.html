<p><span>When you create an annotation, you should always associate it with a particular code and node. Once you've selected the code/node, that annotation will always appear when you search for all data and observations about the node in question.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The annotation process is one of the most re-visited processes during qualitative data analysis. Adding annotations can happen at any time in the&nbsp;research process. However, as a beginner you might find yourself adding annotations after you're more familiar with your dataset. Additionally, valuable new codes and nodes might emerge during your annotation process. </span></p>
<p>In NVivo you can choose to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">show </span>or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">hide</span> annotations throughout the research process. As you work, some annotations may no longer be useful to the study while others must be placed at the top of your data hierarchy.</p>
