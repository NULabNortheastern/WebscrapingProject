NVivo allows you to annotate and code documents using user-created <strong>tags</strong> (<strong>nodes </strong>and <strong>codes</strong>), summarize and visualize these codes, and organize research materials.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>NVivo is particularly helpful for organizing and annotating research materials such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>secondary sources: scholarly articles, newspaper articles, and book chapters&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>primary sources: any primary sources you may be analyzing such as interview transcripts, texts, or field notes</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>your own notes about your project (you can even compose in NVivo)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>As a reminder, <strong>tags</strong> are the specific words or phrases developed by researchers to garner additional insights about or make connections between different <strong>codes </strong>(overall themes). </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Nodes</strong> are summaries/collections of references about a specific theme, case, or relationship that appear across different project items. Nodes are typically developed <span style="text-decoration: underline;">after</span> codes have been established, and are focused on providing more&nbsp;specific information or examples of codes.&nbsp;In this way, using nodes helps show the frequency with which codes appear across qualitative datasets as well and help researchers gain better insight into which codes are most important for the study. You can read more about nodes <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://help-nv11.qsrinternational.com/desktop/concepts/about_nodes.htm" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As you see in the image below, multiple nodes exist within overarching codes. You will add nodes over time as you better understand your data!&nbsp;</span></p>
