It also has other functions:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Create projects that store, organize, and code documents/files</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Provide a method for you to code your documents with a user-created coding schema</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Query, summarize, organize, and visualize information about your coding&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Conduct forms of computational text analysis, like word counts, on the documents themselves</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>With NVivo, you can store and organize your </span><strong>primary</strong><span> and </span><strong>secondary</strong><span> sources together (most file types work, including images). You can also separate your different types of research materials.</span></p>
<p><span>NVivo also allows you to </span><strong>annotate</strong><span> texts and use </span><strong>qualitative coding</strong><span> methods to highlight specific texts/images/pieces under themes. </span></p>
<p><span>Then you can <strong>summarize</strong> and <strong>visualize</strong> these annotations and codes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>See the images below for some examples of how annotations look on Mac and Windows systems.&nbsp;</em></p>
