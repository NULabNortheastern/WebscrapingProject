<p><span>Qualitative coding is when you create a list of themes, or a </span><strong>schema</strong><span>, that you want to highlight in a source or set of sources. Then, you go through your sources and highlight particular moments from the text according to those themes.</span></p>
<p>Here is how coding can look in NVivo - you can see the main text, and how the language is marked with codes and annotations - by <strong>highlights</strong> and <strong>coding stripes</strong>.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>The <strong>coded</strong> portions of the text mark something <strong>significant or important to future research</strong><em> </em>on the text.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take another look at the passage you coded in the previous activity and consider the following :&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Identify any shared themes or patterns among the language you coded.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Think about ways that displays or color coding might make it easier to see or draw out themes in the language.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li>What impact does color choice have on differentiating between separate codes? How can color choice unite potentially related codes?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>These are concepts we hope you'll ponder as you work through this module and get to know qualitative coding as a practice.&nbsp;</p>
