For example, if you have several transcripts from different trials, but want to categorize the type of trial for each text, you would use cases to do so.</span></p>
<p><span>Cases can be created manually and automatically. The images in the next pages will show you how to create a case manually in NVivo. However, if you have an existing project in NVivo you can generate cases automatically by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">importing</span> codes from: an existing NVivo project, a survey or existing dataset, or auto-coded source content. If you prefer to automatically create cases, it's important to ensure that your dataset is “clean”--i.e., contains easily readable and uniquely named columns.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Creating cases helps you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Group related sources</li>
<li>Compare sources and various perspectives from interview participants</li>
<li>Record demographic information</li>
<li>Visualize the project and its data&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, cases help you further isolate your data observations particularly to show shared and differing perspectives across various populations and sites.&nbsp;</p><script src="https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145230000000000001/attachments/22977597/dp_app%20%25282%2529.js"></script>
