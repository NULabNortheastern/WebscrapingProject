<p><span>NVivo is a software&nbsp;typically used as a literature review and research tool for qualitative data analysis, specifically<strong>&nbsp;qualitative coding</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Qualitative coding</strong> is the process by which researchers assign "codes" that help them interpret, organize, and structure observations and interpretations from qualitative data (for example, interviews) into meaningful theories and methods. In short, qualitative coding is a reflective and reflexive process that deals primarily with words, structuring meaning, and interpretation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>NVivo is designed to assist researchers in organizing and analyzing non-numerical and unstructured data. It is useful for coding surveys, interviews, audio recordings, text documents, and other data formats. The software supports a large variety of file formats and data sources including Qualtrics, Zotero, OneNote, EverNote, SurveyMonkey, Excel, Word, and .pdfs among many others. NVivo can be used for both literature reviews, research management, and analysis.</span></p>
<p>To get started, here are some terms to help you familiarize yourself with qualitative coding environments like NVivo. These terms will appear frequently throughout this module; feel free to return to this list at any time as you work through the module.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span>Qualitative Coding Terms</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Qualitative Data</strong><span>: Non-numerical information organized to be used for research. In NVivo, the data includes the files you have imported or created in the software. This can also include metadata, or data about your data (for example titles, creators, or dates of creation). In general, qualitative data can include: interviews, documents, photographs, transcriptions, audio/video recordings, and more.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong>Schema: </strong>A set of themes (i.e., codes) that have been defined by the words and phrases researchers assign to different categories of data.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Tags: </strong>Structured, organized, and searchable words and phrases that make it easier for researchers to garner insights from overall codes. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Codes: </strong><span>The themes, concepts, or sentiments in your research material and data. Codes in NVivo are separated into two broad categories: nodes and relationships.</span>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nodes: </strong><span>Nodes are the themes, concepts, ideas, opinions, or experiences of your data. Nodes can also be organized with tiered or ‘children’ nodes underneath ‘parent’ nodes.</span></li>
<li><strong>Relationships: </strong><span>Relationships in NVivo are a special type of code that is a connection between two data items. Relationships can be one-way (for example: someone employing someone else), associative (such as: two people knowing each other), or symmetrical (for instance: two people working together).</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cases: </strong><span>In NVivo, cases are the unit of analysis for your research. For example, if you are studying a group population, your cases would be the individuals in that group. You can assign different variables and attributes to your cases</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Memos</strong>: Memos are more extended write-ups of your analytical insights, based on what you have coded. You can think about it like a mid-point between your codes and annotations on one hand, and the actual text in the paper that you are writing on the other.</span></li>
<li><strong>Maps: </strong><span>Maps in NVivo are a useful visualization tool for seeing connections between the cases and nodes in your data.</span></li>
<li><strong>Query: </strong><span>Queries in the context of NVivo are a flexible way to explore and analyze your data and codes. With a query you can count word frequency, assign new codes based on a search, and perform searches based upon case attributes.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NVivo-specific features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Highlights: highlighted text for a node or a code. Works in conjunction with coding stripes to make important information more visible.&nbsp;</li>
<li aria-level="1">Coding stripes : colored bars that show you the nodes that code the content you are viewing. Hover over coding stripes to see more information.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Annotations: NVivo tool that helps you record comments, questions, reminders, and other notes-related observations to specific codes and nodes. Annotations will be highlighted in blue, and they can be accessed in the annotations tab.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Visualization: &nbsp;NVivo allows you to visualize your data. The software is capable of generating several common data visualizations including&nbsp;<span>tables and charts, network graphs, cluster diagrams, treemaps, word clouds, maps, and others.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li>Memos: <span>Memos are more extended write-ups of your analytical insights, based on what you have coded. You can think about it like a mid-point between your codes and annotations on one hand, and the actual text in the paper that you are writing on the other.</span>&nbsp;</li>
