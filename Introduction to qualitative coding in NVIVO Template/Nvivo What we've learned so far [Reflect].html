<p>So far, we've discussed some of the foundational concepts of qualitative coding and described some of the capabilities of NVivo. At this point, you should know a bit about the anatomy of NVivo, what type of data you can use with NVivo, and some of the tool's basic functions. We encourage you to take some time to familiarize yourself with the NVivo environment a bit more, downloading and installing the software, exploring the environment, and looking at some of the functions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we move on, take a moment to reflect on these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is it necessary for researchers to identify and clearly define a series of "codes" in qualitative research?&nbsp;</li>
<li>What is the difference between codes and nodes?&nbsp;</li>
<li>How might strong visual indicators (such as color choice) and controlled, descriptive names for various codes and nodes impact your research?&nbsp;</li>
