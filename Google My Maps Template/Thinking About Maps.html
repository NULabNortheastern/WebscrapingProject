<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Maps are powerful tools for conveying geospatial information</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Well-made maps can quickly and easily give </span><strong>content </strong><span>and </span><strong>context,</strong><span> but poorly made maps can be misleading&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>How do you use maps in your <strong>everyday life</strong>?</span></li>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>How does a subway map compare to a Google map?</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>What are these maps doing? How do they shape your expectations and experiences?&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h3>How do maps represent reality?</h3>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Maps can be very powerful ways of conveying information, but maps are also </span><i><span>inherently limited&nbsp;</span></i><span>and it is important to remember that maps always reflect the intention and perspective of the map-maker.</span></li>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Boston is as much a human idea as a physical space, and thus maps both represent and </span><i><span>create</span></i><span> reality.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>The simplicity and clarity of maps is deceiving, and we should question it. But the artificial clarity is necessary for the map to be </span><i><span>useful</span></i><span>. Think of the maps that are useful to you: they filter out the information that is less relevant to what you’re using the map for. (Imagine, for example, trying to navigate a busy city street using the satellite view in Google!)</span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h3><span>Questions for Critiquing Maps</span></h3>
<p><span>From Shannon Mattern, professor of anthropology at The New School (</span><a href="https://wordsinspace.net/shannon/2013/09/05/critiquing-maps-ii/"><span>“Critiquing Maps II”</span></a><span>):</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>What is its subject?</span></li>
<li><span>What is its "message" or "argument" or purpose?</span></li>
<li><span>How was the map made?</span></li>
<li><span>What is its geographic/spatial area?</span></li>
<li><span><em>When</em> is this map?</span></li>
<li><span>Who made this map? Editorial choices?</span></li>
<li><span>Who is/are the map's audiences?</span></li>
<li><span>What are the map's materiality and form?</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Challenges in Historical Maps</span></h3>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Working with historical maps and data can be particularly challenging.&nbsp;</span></li>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Historical information is often partial or complicated, but maps tend to show specific, concrete information.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Historical landscapes can shift over time (for example, a substantial portion of the Charles was filled in during the 19th century to create what is now Back Bay).</span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><span><span>Think about what is </span><strong>particularly difficult to represent</strong><span> or how there might be complexities you should standardize to map your data. Pay close attention to these moments and think about how they impact your understanding of maps as a method for conveying information.</span></span></p><script src="https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145230000000000001/attachments/22977597/dp_app%20%25282%2529.js"></script>
