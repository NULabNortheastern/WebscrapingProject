<p><img src="https://northeastern.instructure.com/courses/27668/files/11331752/preview?verifier=279VSS92cBiSFojLPBMxjsvY34YnIdgQFQyixBgk" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-21 at 12.43.06 PM.png" data-api-endpoint="https://northeastern.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/27668/files/11331752" data-api-returntype="File" loading="lazy"></p>
<ul>
<li>Search for the location you want and select "Add to Map"</li>
<li>Google My Maps does not always recognize place names; you might need to look up the address or location instead</li>
<li>If you cannot find the address for a location, you can select the marker icon and click on the spot where you wish to add the marker</li>
</ul>
<h3>Add More Data to Markers</h3>
<p>For all markers, you can add a title, description, images, videos, links, and customizable color.</p>
<p>When you click on a marker, you will see an edit box that includes a variety of tools.</p>
<p><img src="https://northeastern.instructure.com/courses/27668/files/11331813/preview?verifier=HEmNvD4A9FYFQduQIAd9wTlu1zsLEBr69QkKKjwW" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-21 at 12.46.44 PM.png" data-api-endpoint="https://northeastern.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/27668/files/11331813" data-api-returntype="File" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Tools, left to right: Style; Edit title and description; Add images/video; Directions to here; and Delete marker, line, or polygon.</p>
<p>You can change the color and icon of the marker by using the "Style" tool.</p>
<h3>Lines and Polygons</h3>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Google My Maps can also add </span><strong>lines and polygons</strong><span> to your map. Lines and polygons use fixed points on the map that you select to visualize key information.&nbsp;</span></li>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Lines can demonstrate routes and directions. Lines are easiest to add when you’re representing the shape of a route that already exists.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Polygons can demonstrate towns, neighborhoods, buildings, parks, or anything you would like to mark the shape of in your map. Polygons allow you to contain more of a space than a map marker or a line allows.</span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h3><span>Add Lines and Polygons</span></h3>
<p><span>From the tools under the address search bar, click "Add line or shape"</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://northeastern.instructure.com/courses/27668/files/11331938/preview?verifier=0d18VImIAueUyCYIM3sbsKEYAAS8rwpRlKsJnu0A" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-21 at 12.50.59 PM.png" width="375" height="196" data-api-endpoint="https://northeastern.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/27668/files/11331938" data-api-returntype="File" loading="lazy"></span></p>
<p><strong>For lines,</strong> click where you want to start drawing and then click each corner or bend of the line; double click when you are done with the line.</p>
<p><strong>For polygons,&nbsp;</strong>click where you want to start drawing, click each corner or bend of the line, and click back on the first point to finish the shape.</p>
<h3>Adding More Data to Line or Polygons</h3>
<p>For lines and polygons, the tool options are almost the same as those on the map markers (Style; Edit title and description; Add images/video; and Delete marker, line, or polygon). Using these tools you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customize the color, transparency, and width.</li>
<li>Add a title, description, images, videos, and links.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Layers</h3>
<p><span>Layers allow you to sort/filter your geospatial information into different groups. All of your markers, lines, and polygons will be placed into an “Untitled Layer,” so always make sure to title the layer even if you will only have one.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Individual layers can be turned on and off.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Layers can be exported individually as KML (a markup language for expressing geographic annotation) to view in Google Earth</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>To add a new layer, click “Add Layer”</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Title the layer</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Add markers, lines, or polygons!</span></li>
