<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Know where your microphone is located and keep it clear of papers/other objects</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Use headphones/earbuds when recording and editing</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Prevent the “echo effect”</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Take ambient noise into consideration</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>A/C units, refrigerators, traffic, pets, roommates, loud clothing, etc.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Ideally, find a room with good sound absorption&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Yes: carpet, cushions, bookshelves, clothes (bedrooms, closets)</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>No: larger spaces with hard surfaces (kitchens, bathrooms)</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Consider: Does the room have an echo? Hard floors/countertops/stainless steel surfaces?</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Record test audio and adjust mic volume if necessary</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Record a few seconds of silence at the start and end of each track</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Begin way in advance, and do several takes</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Editing often takes longer than recording itself!</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Don’t be afraid to stop and start over if you mess up! You’ll save more time in the long run</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Stop recording and start again at the top of the sentence to avoid jarring sound cuts in post-production</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Sounding Like a Professional</span></h3>
<p><span>Your podcast should have an&nbsp;</span><strong>argument</strong><span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;</span><strong>perspective</strong><span>, not just a recitation of facts. Even if you’re not speaking with anyone else in your podcast, try to keep your tone&nbsp;</span><strong>persuasive</strong><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><strong>conversational</strong><span>. Like any good piece of reporting, your podcast should be&nbsp;</span><strong>organized</strong><span>&nbsp;and rehearsed ahead of time.&nbsp; The more you&nbsp;</span><strong>practice</strong><span>&nbsp;your script, the less “scripted” it will sound.</span></p>
<p><span>Do your research and have your script written&nbsp;</span><strong>before</strong><span>&nbsp;you start recording; know how your show is laid out and how much time you have.</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Write out large numbers and/or complicated words/names out phonetically (twenty-two thousand and thirty-four vs. 22,034)</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Mark out spaces in the script for pauses, sound clips/effects, transitions between topics, etc.</span></li>
<li><span>Speak slowly, clearly, and conversationally</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>If you use too many "filler words" (um, like, so) you can always edit them out later</span></li>
</ul>
