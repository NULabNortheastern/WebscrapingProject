<p><i><span>Audacity does not auto-save!</span></i><i> </i><span>Don’t forget to save your recording, early and often!</span></p>
<p><span>Try and save after each major edit/input of a recording, just to be safe.</span></p>
<p><strong>File &gt; Save Project &gt; Save Project As&gt; “Name of your podcast”</strong></p>
<p><span>And once your project is saved the first time, you can just update the file:</span></p>
<p><strong>File &gt; Save Project &gt; Save Project &gt; [saves the updates to your file]</strong></p>
<h3>Exporting and Sharing</h3>
<p><span>Finished with your recording?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Make sure you export your project as an </span><strong>MP3</strong><span> before you send or share it! This will ensure that other people are able to listen to it correctly (anyone who does not have Audacity downloaded will not be able to open your project file otherwise).</span></p>
<p><strong>File &gt; Export &gt; Export as MP3</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><span>Select “best quality”</span></p><script src="https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145230000000000001/attachments/22977597/dp_app%20%25282%2529.js"></script>
