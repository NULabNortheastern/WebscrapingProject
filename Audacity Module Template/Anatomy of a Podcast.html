<p><span>Podcasts typically begin with an </span><strong>opening segment</strong><span> of 10-30 seconds of music* and audio wherein the creator identifies the </span><strong>podcast title</strong><span>, </span><strong>host</strong><span>, and </span><strong>episode topic</strong><span>—this creates a nice trademark/signature, and indicates to the listener that the podcast is about to begin.&nbsp; </span><strong>Be as creative as you want!</strong></p>
<p><span>*Consider the emotions and perceptions sounds evoke in listeners when choosing music and sound effects for your intro (spooky violins, dramatic horns, happy guitars, etc.)</span></p>
<p><span>From the opening segment alone, we can make certain assumptions about the podcast:</span></p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Audience</strong><span>: people interested in history of Hollywood, censorship, intellectual property</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Genre</strong><span>: journalism, non-fiction historical narrative</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Structure: </strong><span>original narration with sound clips and story segments</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Media</strong><span>: theme song music, sound effects, archival audio clips</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>These are all components to keep in mind not only when crafting your opening segment, but your <strong>entire podcast. </strong></span></p>
<h3><span>Opening Segment Example: <em>You Must Remember This</em></span></h3>
<p><span>Listen to the opening segment to </span><a href="http://www.youmustrememberthispodcast.com/episodes/blacklist-hollywood-ten"><span>“Crossfire”</span></a><span> (through 1:13) from Karina Longworth’s </span><i><span>You Must Remember This </span></i><span>podcast, an episode about censorship and the Hollywood blacklist during the Cold War.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Questions to keep in mind:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>What audio techniques do they use to engage their audience?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>How do they introduce their topic?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>What kinds of media are included?</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>The Body</span></h3>
<p>The introduction and concluding sections are important for engaging the audience and orienting them to the central section of the podcast: the body. This is where the content of the podcast will be. Important things to keep in mind when drafting the body of the podcast:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create distinct sections that are identified by signposts. Breaking up the body into sections helps make it more understandable to listeners.</li>
<li>Make sure there is a legible organization to the information. For example, when retelling a historical event organize chronologically.&nbsp;</li>
<li>It is hard to sit and listen to long periods of narration without breaks. Add bump clips or other audio components to improve the engagement and legibility of the podcast.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3><span>The Outro</span></h3>
<p><span>Podcasts typically end with a </span><strong>closing segment</strong><span> of 10–30 seconds of music and audio wherein the creator names the </span><strong>creator(s)</strong><span>, </span><strong>institutional affiliation</strong><span>, and </span><strong>audio/production credits, </strong><span>including people whose work or advice has significantly influenced or contributed to the episode.</span></p>
<p><span>An outro script for your class might sound something like “This podcast was made by [student name] for [professor's name]'s class at Northeastern University...opening music created by [artist name], sound effects taken from [repository name]... with special thanks to [name] for their contribution”</span></p>
<p><span>As in your opening segment, you can use music and sound effects to make your closing segment dynamic and interesting.</span></p>
<h3><span>Closing Segment Example: <em>Slow Burn: The Road to the Iraq War</em></span></h3>
<p><span>Now listen to the concluding segment to <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://slate.com/podcasts/slow-burn/s5/road-to-the-iraq-war/e1/ahmad-chalabi" target="_blank">"The Exile"</a> (from 48:38 onward) from The Slate's <em>Slow Burn: The Road to the Iraq War&nbsp;</em>podcast, an episode about the exile of Ahmad Chalabi. Compare the techniques used in the outro to the techniques used in the intro segment from Crossfire. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>What decisions were made to keep the audience engaged?</span></li>
<li><span>How does the content of a podcast affect the tone of the media included?</span></li>
