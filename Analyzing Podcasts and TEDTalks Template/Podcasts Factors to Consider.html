<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Due to the </span><strong>sheer volume</strong><span> of podcasts available, it can be very difficult for podcasts to gain an audience</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The </span><strong>price of production</strong><span> for “professional-sounding” podcasts (technology, software, promotion, labor) can be </span><strong>prohibitively expensive</strong><span> without advertisements or corporate sponsorships&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Podcasts have to follow detailed protocols for </span><strong>copyright and fair use</strong></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Because podcasts are</span><strong> </strong><span>edited in </span><strong>post-production</strong><span>, interview materials can be edited, redacted, or otherwise misrepresented</span></li>
</ul>
