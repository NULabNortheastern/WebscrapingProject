<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span>TEDTalk Structure</span></h3>
<p><span>TEDTalks are similar to traditional conference presentations, but rely heavily on </span><strong>oral storytelling techniques</strong><span> and prioritize the use of </span><strong>everyday language</strong><span> to make research findings more </span><strong>accessible to</strong> <strong>wider audiences.</strong></p>
<p><span>Generally, TEDTalks follow a </span><strong>narrative arc</strong><span>, with a clear introduction, middle, and end.&nbsp; Popular TEDTalk structures tend to look something like this:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intro</strong><span>: Informal, Personal, and/or Interactive Introduction to the Research</span></li>
<li><strong>Middle</strong><span>: Questions, Struggles, and Complications in the Research</span></li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong><span>: Research Findings, Resolutions, and Takeaways (The “Bigger Picture”)</span></li>
</ul>
