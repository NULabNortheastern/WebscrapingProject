<p><span>Though TED grants free, limited licenses for local TEDx events to occur all over the world, these licenses are </span><strong>binding legal contracts</strong><span> with strict rules about how the TED logo can be used, how TEDx events are named, how stages should look, how videos are produced, and which topics are allowed. </span></p>
<p><span>Following are some of the additional factors that you should know about TED:<br></span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>TED is currently curated by </span><strong>one person</strong><span>: Chris Anderson, a British-American businessman</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The price of attendance for the annual in-person TED Conference is </span><strong>ten thousand dollars</strong><span> per person</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Corporate sponsorships</strong><span> for TED include Google, Coca-Cola, and Goldman Sachs</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Talks given by academics or professors at established universities in STEM-adjacent fields tend to be watched more than talks on art or design</span></li>
</ul>
