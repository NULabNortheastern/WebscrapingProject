This will help you to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Keep track of your resources</span></li>
<li><span>Add and edit collaboratively with your team</span></li>
<li><span>Storyboard your map, making sure that the flow between locations makes sense</span></li>
<li><span>Save content in case you loose progress in the StoryMap tool</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Organizing your data first can help you keep track of the source materials, so you can determine if you have a balanced amount of information for each location. This can also help with the clarity and consistency of your writing in each of the StoryMap slides.</span></p>
<p><span>Once your data is organized, you can copy and paste from your spreadsheet into StoryMap.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>A Note on Save States</strong></span></p>
<p><span>StoryMaps does not keep older versions of your project, so once you make and save changes, </span><strong>you cannot retrieve a previous version</strong><span>. You can also overwrite new content if you have your StoryMap open in multiple browser tabs or windows at once.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This is one reason why it is a good idea to plan out your StoryMap in a separate document: if you lose progress, you will have your content saved somewhere else.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Template for Content Curation</strong></h3>
<p><strong><span>Curating your content is one of the first steps in building your StoryMap. </span></strong></p>
<p><span>You can make a copy of the StoryMap template below and use it to fill in the different sites you want to map, images you want to include, and so on. Note that this spreadsheet is in Excel, but you might find it useful to upload it into Google and convert to a Google Sheet, if you will be working collaboratively on a team.&nbsp;</span></p>

<li aria-level="1"><span>The </span><strong>slide number </strong><span>(column A) can serve as the order in which your sites appear on your map and the</span><strong> site name</strong><span> (column B) can be used to label sites on your map.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The </span><strong>site location</strong><span> (column C) is used to identify a point on your map where the site is physically located (address or coordinates).</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The</span><strong> image URL/File location</strong><span> (column D) is useful in keeping track of images of sites. Always </span><strong>credit </strong><span>(column E) your images to indicate their origin. Also include a </span><strong>caption</strong><span> (column F) describing your image.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The </span><strong>headline</strong><span> (column G) can serve as the official title or label of your site. Including a </span><strong>narrative</strong><span> (column H) provides </span><span>more context as to why your site is important</span><span>.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Citation is important! Do not forget to cite your sources. (Column I)</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>You may want to include additional media related to your site (e.g. newspaper clippings, additional photos, etc.). Use Columns J and K for this, and expand as needed. </span></li>
