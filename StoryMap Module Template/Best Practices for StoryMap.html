<li><span>StoryMap<strong> DOES NOT Autosave</strong>, so<strong> SAVE your work OFTEN</strong>.</span></li>
<li><span>StoryMaps does not keep older versions of your project, so once you make and save changes, <strong>you cannot retrieve a previous version</strong>. You can also overwrite new content if you have your StoryMap open in multiple browser tabs or windows at once. This is one reason why it is a good idea to plan out your StoryMap in a separate document: if you lose progress, you will have your content saved somewhere else.</span></li>
<li><span>Before you publish, <strong>t</strong></span><strong><span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-size: 1rem;">est your map</span></strong><span> after you have created it! You should make sure that all the narrative points flow, the language is clear and concise, and presentation is visually pleasing.</span></li>
<li><span>The default for StoryMap can be very upbeat and informal, and that may not match the content you are sharing. You may want to customize the map properties like map design, font type/color, background image/color etc.</span></li>

<li aria-level="1"><span>DITI recommends that students set up a StoryMap account with an email address all group members can access. </span>Designate <strong style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-size: 1rem;">one</strong><i style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-size: 1rem;"> </i><span>person to input information into the StoryMap. All group members should contribute to the StoryMap data collection/management Spreadsheet template and divide labor accordingly.&nbsp;</span></li>
