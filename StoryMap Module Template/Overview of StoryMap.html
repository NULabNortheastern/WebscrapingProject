<h3>What is a “story map”?</h3>
<p>Telling a story using maps!&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;“<strong>You combine authoritative maps with narrative text, images, and multimedia content. They make it easy to harness the power of maps and geography to tell your story.</strong>”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>- ESRI Story Maps Website</span></p>
<p><span>To get a sense of how story maps work, let's briefly consider the example project below. Navigate to the hyperlink and click "Start Exploring." Click through a few of the points to get a sense of how linear narratives and geographic space are intersecting in this story map. On the next page, you'll examine a few more examples and consider some questions for reflection and discussion.</span><em></em></p>
