If so, then the application is approved! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, do think about </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the potential consequences of what could happen next. For example, in one possible scenario, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a year after the dog is adopted, you reach out to the owner to see how the dog is doing. It turns out they put the dog up for adoption again because they want to move to a new apartment that does not allow dogs.</span></p>
<p>Did the majority of you decide to <span style="font-weight: 400;">REJECT? If so, then the application is rejected! Again think of some potential consequences that could occur. For instance, it may be months before anyone else puts in an adoption application for the dog, and a very long time before it finally is adopted.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Reflect on this entire exercise and think about w</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hy particular questions are included on the application form. What might we infer from these questions? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider the question about pet insurance. It checks if someone is committed to spending money on their dog. However, this also can be an indicator of assessing an applicant's </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">economic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> class to determine if they are well-off.</span>
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider the rent/own the house question. The question checks if the applicant is likely to move often, if the landlord would allow a dog or not, if the person has adequate space, etc. Again, however, this also relates to the economic class of the applicant.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span>This is a complex situation and there isn't really a right answer; even with algorithms, results and ramifications can be very complex. Sometimes there can be harmful consequences and sometimes good ones.</span></span></p><script src="https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145230000000000001/attachments/22977597/dp_app%20%25282%2529.js"></script>
