<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opportunities</span></h3>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One, big data is massive and passive, involving a great many observations that are often collected as side products of different activities, so it can provide a lot of information and doesn't necessarily require setting up specific collection systems.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two, big data gives us the opportunity to collect data on social systems themselves. In other words, big data allows for the possibility of observing how people interact with specific systems, like social media.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three, big data also allows for new natural and field experiments. New types of experiments can be done thanks to services like social media. For example, <a class="instructure_file_link inline_disabled" href="https://www.nature.com/news/facebook-experiment-boosts-us-voter-turnout-1.11401" target="_blank">Facebook did experiments in voting behavior</a> by telling some users that their friends voted in order to encourage them to go to the polls, while other users did not see anything.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, big data also gives us the opportunity to make big data small. Due to the size of big data, we can slice data into smaller chunks to analyze previously unstudied populations because previous sample sizes were too small.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vulnerabilities</span></h3>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First is generalizability, and this goes back to the fourth “V,” Veracity. We often can't be sure if the big data is actually representative of true social systems, relationships, and interactions. Therefore, we may make policy decisions based on flawed data or a flawed understanding of data.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next is that there are “too much big data.” What this means is that there are many big data sources and these are scattered across the industry, academia, and government. It can be difficult to bring them together into something useful.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A third flaw is artifacts, reactivity, and drift. In other words, how someone uses an online system today may be different than how they use the same system tomorrow. Therefore, the data we are collecting may not be comparable across time.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A final major vulnerability is the "ideal user assumption", which means data scientists assuming that each user represents a real person. However, bots do exist online (especially on social media) and people may be purposefully manipulating data for any number of reasons.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other considerations</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big data allows for something called “nowcasting.” Because the data is passive and collected in real-time, we can collect data and use algorithms to make real-time decisions like rerouting buses to fill dynamic transportation patterns. In this context, the passive and real-time data collection can be seen as an opportunity; however, if the real-time data is being collected along with identifiers, but without users' consent, then this can be seen as a breach of privacy.<br></span></p><script src="https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145230000000000001/attachments/22977597/dp_app%20%25282%2529.js"></script>
