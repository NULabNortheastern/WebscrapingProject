<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <strong>four components of big data are volume, variety, velocity, and veracity</strong>.<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, big data is, as its name suggests, very large in volume, with thousands, millions, or even billions of observations across a massive population.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second component of big data is variety. Big data is often collected from many different sources and combined together, providing new and more comprehensive datasets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third is velocity. Big data is usually collected in real-time as a side product of a different process without people necessarily knowing that they are being observed. For example, transportation big data could be the result of people across Boston swiping their CharlieCard to board busses and trains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fourth is veracity. We should always be wary of the truthfulness and generalizability of big data because it is not necessarily representative. We need to understand the limits of what big data is and what it is telling us.</span></p><script src="https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145230000000000001/attachments/22977597/dp_app%20%25282%2529.js"></script>
