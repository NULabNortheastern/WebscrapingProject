Also, the computing processes and data itself may reflect the biases of people and society.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Amazon attempted to create an algorithm to analyze potential hires’ resumes. Their input data were people who had been hired at tech companies and people who were not hired. Because tech companies are a male-dominated field, the input data reflected this. The algorithm interpreted any mention of “women” in the new resumes as negative and rejected these applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this modern era, machine learning and artificial intelligence are becoming ubiquitous, and decisions are increasingly automated and being processed by algorithms. Hence, it is important to remember that algorithms will be biased and we should remain critical of the recommendations from artificial intelligence. Privacy law experts believe that the codes and data for artificial intelligence and algorithms that impact people's life should be made more fair and transparent. </span></p>
