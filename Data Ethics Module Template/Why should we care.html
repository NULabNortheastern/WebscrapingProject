And so, <strong>our information is the product </strong>that is being traded<strong> </strong>by businesses. For example, we may think we are using the apps and websites for free; however, we are giving the app and website owners our data, which they use to generate advertisement revenue. H</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ave you ever received targeted advertisements? For example, you searched for a new mattress and looked at few reviews on YouTube. Soon your Facebook, YouTube, and other platforms will start showing you ads for mattresses! This happens because companies purchase activity data from YouTube/Instagram/Facebook etc. and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">they have categorized you as a potential customer.</span></p>
<p>Because of all this, it is important to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How are we being represented online?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How are our data being used?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who is using our data and for what purposes?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How might our data be used in the future?</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>How are experts and researchers using big data in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic? Have you read any articles that shared results from a big data analysis? What different types of data did the article use? Was it really big data or was it just large data?</li>
<li>Are large-scale monitoring and surveillance systems a breach of individuals' privacy? In a pandemic, is the tradeoff between (some level of) privacy and the health/safety of a community/nation worth considering?</li>
</ul>
