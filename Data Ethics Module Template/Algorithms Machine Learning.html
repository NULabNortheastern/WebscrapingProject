(That is, the machine is instructed to "learn" what to do, based on particular input specifications.)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Supervised machine learning</strong> is where a computer is supplied with characterized and labeled data to “train” the computer to recognize patterns based on the dataset. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Computer vision facial recognition is an example of supervised machine learning. Modern facial recognition software packages train themselves to recognize faces by being fed hundreds of thousands of face images.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Unsupervised machine learning</strong> is where a computer is given uncharacterized data and allowed to build its own inference structure without the guidance of a human “trainer.” A great example is AlphaZero--a computer created by Google and programmers who only gave it the rules of chess. The computer then trained itself by playing chess against itself millions of times. AlphaZero was then able to beat existing chess programs and chess masters. Now, people are trying to learn from AlphaZero.</span></p><script src="https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145230000000000001/attachments/22977597/dp_app%20%25282%2529.js"></script>
