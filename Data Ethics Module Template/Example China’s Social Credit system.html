<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China's social credit system is a national reputation system currently being developed. It uses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> big data technologies to collect information about citizens and determine who are "ideal" Chinese citizens and who are not. This surveillance system tracks what people purchase, where they go, what they do, who they talk to, what they talk about, and more. All these different data points are used to evaluate and categorize people.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are underlying ideologies in these data points and categories. Good citizens as determined by this system are less likely to jaywalk, to purchase alcohol, to speak with those who have low credit scores, to speak out against the government, and so on. This system makes explicit a whole set of assumptions about what makes a "good" Chinese citizen and, more importantly, instills in people an understanding of how their every</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;move is surveyed and categorized.</span></p>
