<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This module will introduce important concepts related to data ethics, including what big data is and how it works, algorithmic bias, and questions and guidelines for ethical research. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big data is the collection of mass amounts of data and the quick analysis of this data to study large-scale patterns. Studies in algorithmic bias explore how algorithms can reinforce implicit and potentially harmful biases, including biases in the data used and collected for algorithms, the choices made in algorithm creation, and the impact of algorithmic systems on people's lives. Finally, this module will discuss how implicit biases may exist in research.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning Goals</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understand the ways in which technology reflects cultural, social, and political biases.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understand the ways data is being used in society as well as how algorithms impact our daily lives (in both positive and negative ways).&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explore the ways in which privacy and security are being redefined through the use of big data, algorithms, and policy.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explore the ways in which these questions and methods are influencing how humanists and social scientists do research.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning Objectives</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span>By the end of this module, you should be able to:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Define “big data” and point to different digital technologies that rely on this type of collection and analysis.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Point to algorithms that are used to make important decisions, like risk assessment algorithms and targeted advertising.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tackle questions about implicit bias to be considered when conducting research, especially collecting and analyzing data. </span></li>
