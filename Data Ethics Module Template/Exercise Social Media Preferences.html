For instance, Facebook collects, stores, and sells information about you</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: what you write in your profile information, where you click and go online, whom you talk to, what you say in messenger, and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook collects data to create a profile that describes who you are and how advertisers may use that information to better target you. If you've ever noticed that the same people and ideas tend to pop up on your newsfeed, that’s because Facebook’s algorithm can categorize your interests in terms of politics, social interests, and so on--and then your newsfeed reflects back to you what you've shown you are interested in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar targeting happens with YouTube (owned by Google), Instagram (owned by Facebook), Google, Twitter, and more. You are categorized by your behaviors and identity markers online.<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are interested in learning about the future of social media marketing, the following journal article is a good start.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check your Facebook advertising preferences</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a Facebook account, log in, and check your advertising preferences using the following path: Settings and Privacy &gt; Settings &gt; Ads &gt; Ad Preferences. Here, you can check the Advertisers you have seen most recently, those you have hidden, and also the ones you have clicked. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following Facebook page example is from a DITI Fellow to demonstrate how Facebook has categorized her. She is a parent/caregiver, according to Facebook, and likes information about children's activities and products like Children Magazines, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Museum of Science, Outschool, etc. This is true. She is also marked as a fresh produce buyer and grower because she follows food forest, gardening and sustainable farming pages; this is less accurate. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some reason, Facebook also thinks she might be interested in auditions and casting calls....guess the algorithm can’t always get everything right!</span></p>

<p>Now, think about what sort of advertisement have you lately seen on your Facebook/Instagram/Twitter page? Why do you think that is? What signals did you give to attract such advertisements?</p><script src="https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145230000000000001/attachments/22977597/dp_app%20%25282%2529.js"></script>
