<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Maps can track your every move and also recognize </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">how</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you’re moving (by train, car, walking, etc.). If you have your location services on, Google knows the places you’ve visited, which you frequent most, and more. If you allow Google to track this information, you can get a monthly report of the places you've been, but you might get also notifications from Google asking you to review particular restaurants or shops--again, showing how your data is being monetized.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go to the following link and view your movement history:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, Google Maps isn’t the end for Google’s data collection. Google knows your search engine patterns, your behaviors online, and more.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can click on the Google Account circle (your photo/initials) at the top right corner and select the ‘Manage your Google Account’ tab. Then select the</span> 'Data &amp; personalization' option on the left-side toolbar to view and manage activity settings for your accounts (Gmail, YouTube, Maps, etc.). You can also g<span style="font-weight: 400;">o to the following link to learn more about your Google settings:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most collected data is not publicly available, but there are ways to collect your own data from some publishers. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram also lets you see your most recent advertisements by going to Settings &gt; Ads &gt; Ad Activity. Here, you can see the ads you are most likely to receive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also scrape data from various sources like Twitter via their APIs. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;An API is an application programming interface, which allows different forms of software to ‘talk to each other’ following certain data formats and conventions.</span></p>
