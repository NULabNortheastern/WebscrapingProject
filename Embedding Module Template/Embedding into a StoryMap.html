<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Use the “Media” section to add media to a slide. You can upload an image or put a </span><strong>URL</strong><span> of an image OR a video (like a YouTube video). If you want to add an image from a URL, just make sure the link you use is for the image file itself (not just a webpage with the image on it)</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>If you have an image or a video in the “Media” section, but want to include an image in the </span><strong>text </strong><span>box, you can! The text box reads basic HTML.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Using the &lt;img&gt; tag in StoryMap</span></h3>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Use the HTML &lt;img&gt; tag to insert the image following this format: </span><span>&lt;img src="URL"&gt;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The </span><strong>&lt;img&gt;</strong><span> creates a holding space for the referenced image&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>src </strong><span>specifies the path to the image&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Fill in the URL of the image within the quotation marks (replacing the text that says URL but without deleting the quotation marks)</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Embed Media and Images on a Slide</span></h3>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Click the &lt;/&gt; button (turn on HTML) <img src="https://northeastern.instructure.com/courses/27668/files/10418599/preview?verifier=cAmCx5QNm1x0X7Mt1NyksjLPhZLDCDscK36iMC9c" alt="Screen Shot 2021-08-13 at 7.40.59 PM.png" width="199" height="49" data-api-endpoint="https://northeastern.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/27668/files/10418599" data-api-returntype="File" loading="lazy">&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Get a URL of your image. Wikimedia Commons is a great source for images. Make sure to use the </span><strong>embed file code</strong><span>--don’t forget to cite!</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Use the HTML &lt;img src="URL"&gt; template to insert the image.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Check the “Preview” to see the image</span></li>
</ol>
<h3>Using HTML to Customize StoryMap</h3>
<p><em>Change the text color in StoryMap</em></p>
<p>To change the text color in KnightLab StoryMaps you’ll need to use the &lt;span&gt; tag in HTML.</p>
<p><span><i></i></span></p>
<p><span>Click the HTML button (&lt;/&gt;) in the editor. Then add the tag; for example: &lt;span style ="color:red"&gt; </span><strong>YOUR TEXT HERE </strong><span>&lt;/span&gt;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Note:</strong> you must open and close the tags appropriately for the code to work.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Be sure to wrap the &lt;span&gt; tag around </span><strong>the entire text</strong><span> you wish to be in a different color.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Experiment with different colors! Try it on your own by changing the color from “red” to “purple”.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><em>Add alternative text for accessibility purposes</em></span></p>
<p><span>You can add alt text with HTML code, using the &lt;img src =&nbsp; </span><span>"IMAGE LINK" </span><span>alt = </span><span>"IMAGE DESCRIPTION" &gt; </span><span>tag to make the image accessible for screenreaders.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Note:</strong> typically, the &lt;img&gt; tag is associated with a specific image. However, the software for StoryMap separates the slide image from the caption. Be aware of this as you make accessibility-related improvements to your StoryMap.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Alternatively, </span><strong>you can do longer-form, more detailed image descriptions within the caption section</strong><span> of the image slide. This may be the best approach considering software limitations. </span>&nbsp;</span></p><script src="https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145230000000000001/attachments/22977597/dp_app%20%25282%2529.js"></script>
