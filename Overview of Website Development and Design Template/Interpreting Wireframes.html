<p>Wireframe examples sourced from <a href="https://cssh.northeastern.edu/faculty/julia-flanders/">Professor Julia Flanders</a>&nbsp;at Northeastern University; from her slide deck: “Wireframing and Project Design Processes.”</p>
<p><span><span>Flowchart-style wireframes center user experience, needs, and projected navigation through a website. Instructions for navigating the website and questions about a site's usability often control the structure of a flowchart in website development processes. </span></span></p>
<p><span>Standard wireframes map the organization of an entire website, and thus include each page of a website and how those pages would connect with each other through hyperlinks or menus. You may also use these wireframes to sketch a layout for each individual webpage as&nbsp;you saw in the previous slide; you can add as little or as much detail as you see fit to your wireframe.&nbsp;</span></p><script src="https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145230000000000001/attachments/22977597/dp_app%20%25282%2529.js"></script>
