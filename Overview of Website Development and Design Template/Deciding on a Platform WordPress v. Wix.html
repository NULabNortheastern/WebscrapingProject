There are some features that set the two platforms apart from each other. In choosing a platform, you will want to think about which features are most essential for the site you plan to create.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WordPress</strong> is renowned for is successful blog components, greater capacity for categorization and tagging, and its overall longevity as a platform for building personal websites for any need. While the templates for basic plans on WordPress are less dynamic, an advantage of this platform is the ability to try new pre-made template layouts on an existing website without having to create a new site. You can also use HTML to create your own custom theme for your WordPress site. This makes it easy to update the appearance of your website for a fresh look without losing your content.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wix&nbsp;</strong>is well-positioned as a platform for retail websites, artistic portfolios, and other internet needs featuring large visual components. While you can only choose a theme once on Wix (note: you must create an entirely new website if you want to start over), Wix is popular for the flexibility within its templates. You can drag and drop different components to customize the appearance of your website or take advantage of its recommended features tool.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Both of these platforms are more than adequate for creating a personal website, and the best way to learn the system is to play around. Also, these sites are ever-changing, so it's important to stay in the loop and experiment on the sites frequently.&nbsp;</span></p>
