<p>A good way to start thinking about website development (planning and design) is to think about what you like as an internet user. Take a moment to consider the questions below and jot down some notes of your own.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>What are some best practices you’ve discovered either building a website or interacting with a website as a user?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>What do you like most about the websites you frequent?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>What bothers you? </span></li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some quick tips to jumpstart your thinking about website development:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Always remember your audience</strong><span> and </span><strong>think about how you want to represent your identity </strong><span>and your work to that audience.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Use the </span><strong>“Preview” </strong><span>button (available on both WordPress and Wix) to see how your site will appear to your audience.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>More ≠ better! </strong><span>You want your website to be easy to navigate, informative, and appealing.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Pick a theme/format that is </span><strong>compatible with mobile phones</strong><span>.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Design choices should be based on the </span><strong>content</strong><span> you are communicating.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>For maximum readability, </span><strong>use simple fonts and a high color contrast </strong><span>between text and background color. This is particularly important for accessibility.&nbsp;</span><span>Here's an example:&nbsp;</span></li>
