Here, we will briefly share <span style="font-weight: 400;">(1) why and how to collect textual data to create a corpus, and (2) how</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to systematize and organize the data.</span></p>
<p><strong>Questions to consider as you begin your research:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are my research questions and why am I creating a corpus?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What am I asking my corpus to do?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What text(s) should form my corpus to answer my research questions?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How should I organize my corpus to streamline my research processes and save time?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Collecting Data<br></strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find and choose a repository or archive that has the data and text(s) that you require to answer your research questions. You can see some possible <a class="instructure_file_link inline_disabled" href="https://web.northeastern.edu/nulab/resources/data-sets/" target="_blank">datasets</a> here.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Retrieve the texts that you will put into your corpus; think carefully about which texts will best help you to answer your research question.&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Texts can be </span><strong>directly related</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to your research question or </span><strong>randomly selected</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you desire sampling from a larger body of work for exploratory purposes. However, even with randomly selected texts, you should still choose documents that are broadly relevant to the topics you wish to research (for instance, you would probably not be able to learn much about contemporary discourse on the internet from a collection of nineteenth-century recipes!).</span>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Download and store your data in a <strong>systematic</strong> way to streamline the analysis process. A well-designed storage system will <strong>save time</strong>, especially with large corpora.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <br></span>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Building a Corpus</strong></p>
<p><span>When building a corpus, especially for a smaller project, follow these three steps.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Choose the texts or text selections that you would like to include.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Remember, these texts are not necessarily representative of a larger body of writing. </span><span>The argument and analysis you're making depend upon the context that you bring to the collection you've selected. Consider any limitations in the corpus's ability to represent the questions your project is seeking to answer.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Create a folder on your computer or cloud storage where you will store your corpus. Give it a clearly descriptive name, without spaces or special characters (for example: "presidential_speeches_corpus").</span></p>
<p><span>3. Once you have chosen the texts you will include, open a plain text editor (for example, Notepad on PCs and TextEdit on Macs). Copy and paste the contents of each document or data selection into the text editor, and save as a .txt file with a descriptive file name. You should u</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">se filenames to indicate the data inside (ex: “2012obama.txt”) and also think about how you might want to sort your files. For example, with a dataset of presidential speeches, if you would want to sort by date first, it would make sense to have "2012obama.txt", "1992clinton.txt", and so on. But, if it would be more useful to sort by president, then this format would work better: "clinton1992.txt" "obama2012.txt", and so on.</span></p>
<p><strong>Repeat steps 1 through 3 for each text in the corpus.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Helpful tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><span>TextEdit on Macs: You must make sure it is configured to work with plain text files. To do this, open Text Edit and go to “Format" and select "Make Plain Text." If you want to configure Text Edit to treat all files as plain text, go to "Preferences," look under the "Format" section, and choose "Plain text." Then, restart TextEdit.</span></li>
<li>
<span>Only copy one text into each new plain text file.&nbsp;</span>Make sure not to put any spaces in the names of the files as you save them. Use underscores or hyphens to mark spaces between words instead.</li>
