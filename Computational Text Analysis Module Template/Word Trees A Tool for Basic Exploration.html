<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A word tree depicts multiple parallel sequences of words. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a good way to <strong>see patterns in word usage</strong>, based on words that appear before and after a term or terms of interest.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some restrictions in size for this particular tool; however, fewer than 1 million words should work fine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Step-by-Step Guide for using Word Trees:</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Go to the Word Trees tool link <a href="https://www.jasondavies.com/wordtree/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.jasondavies.com/wordtree/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>In the 'Paste Text' section, copy the text from the .txt file you want to analyze, and paste it in the space provided.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select or deselect the 'sharable' button based on your preference. If selected, it will save your text on the server.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click the 'Generate WordTree' button.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once the word tree is generated, you can type a word or words in the bar at the top, and a new tree will get generated for your query term(s).</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: </strong>You can also select the 'reverse tree' tab at the top to see the words that precede your query term(s).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Review the results and explore more terms. It is often helpful to try the frequent terms that the WordCounter tool revealed.</p>

<p><strong>A Few Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The default results show the words that appear after the most common "word" (which might be a punctuation character) in your input file, with more frequent combinations appearing in larger text and the subsequent words and word combinations branching off to the right or left.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can enter any word or words that you want to query in the box at the top; note that this ignores casing (so upper and lowercase versions of words are treated as identical).&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can click within the results to look at particular word combinations in more detail.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can look in the sections on the right to see both the full input text and the locations within that text where your queries appear.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It's often useful to look at the trees for very common words, so consider searching for some of the words from your WordCounter results.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that this tool does </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ignore punctuation, so you would first need to remove punctuation from your input document if you wanted to do any kind of analysis that focused just on the words.&nbsp;</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This tool is useful for getting an immediate visual sense of patterns in the contexts within which words are used, but itâ€™s more aimed at exploration and discovery than at in-depth analysis of keywords in context (for example, there is no download option or way to count/track the contexts and usages for particular words).</span></li>
