It offers several sophisticated options for text preparation, and a wide range of different analytical possibilities. Lexos has advanced analysis tools like the "Dendrogram" (a hierarchical cluster analysis tool that can show which texts are most similar to each other) and "Rolling Windows" (a tool to track the frequency of terms across a document). </span><span>Importantly, it also preserves all the changes that are made to a text, so that any results can be reproduced. I</span><span>t also lets you download the prepared corpus, which can then be used in other tools as well.<br></span></p>
<p><span>Lexos provides a workflow of effective practices to help you be cognizant of the choices you are making. Lexos has the following distinct stages for data management and analysis:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Upload</strong><span>: Lexos requires you to upload separate .txt files from your computer. It also has a web scraper tool that lets you download files off the internet.<br></span></li>
<li><strong>Manage</strong><span>: This stage lets you select files <span>you want to prepare and analyze. You can upload a corpus and choose all the files or select a few to prepare and analyze.</span><br></span></li>
<li><strong>Prepare</strong><span>:&nbsp; </span><span>Lexos demonstrates the different options you have for preparing your corpus. By “scrubbing,” you are transforming the texts in your corpus and making choices that will impact your results. Here are some possibilities:</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Make<span> all your letters lowercase. Even though you know “B” and “b” are the same letter, the computer treats these as two separate characters. Lowercasing removes this distinction.</span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Remove<span> punctuation characters. Keeping them may influence your results.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Stop or keep<span> a list of words. Usually, these would be </span>stopwords<span>, or the most common words in a language (English: the, a, she, her, it, him, they, etc).</span><strong></strong></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Use lemmas to <span>standardize words to the </span><i><span>stem</span></i><span> of a word. For example, you can stem all forms of talk: talking, talked, talks, etc. to “talk”.</span></span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Visualize</strong><span>: Here you create visualizations of patterns across your corpus or in single texts. Word Cloud, Multicloud (a comparative wordcloud of each document in the corpus), BubbleViz, and Rolling Windows are the four choices available. The Rolling Windows visualization is explained further in the example section of this page.</span><strong></strong></li>
<li><span><strong>Analyze</strong>: At this stage, you can analyze your corpus or single texts. Statistics, Dendrogram, K-Means, Consensus Tree, Content Analysis are a few of the options available. The Dendrogram analysis is explained in the example section of this page.<br></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Note: </strong>The Lexos demonstration video Part I introduces the Upload, Manage, Prepare and Visualize sections. Part II describes Analyze options in detail.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Step-by-Step Guide for using Lexos</strong></h3>
<p><span><strong>Step 1.</strong> Go to the Lexos website <a href="http://lexos.wheatoncollege.edu/upload">http://lexos.wheatoncollege.edu/upload</a><strong><br></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong> Step 2. </strong></span><span>Click “Browse” and select your entire corpus, separate .txt. files, from the computer.<br></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Step 3. </strong>Manage the file selection. Here the blue color represents 'selected' files and gray represent 'not selected'. Make sure all documents in the corpus you want to use are selected. You can control- or right-click to select or deselect all texts.<br></span></p>

Following are some basic scrubbing steps you can do:<br></span></p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li aria-level="3"><span>Make all your letters lowercase (the computer reads upper and lower case letters as two separate characters).</span></li>
<li aria-level="3"><span>Remove punctuation, which may influence results.</span></li>
<li aria-level="3"><span>Remove a list of words, usually stopwords</span><strong>.</strong> A list of common stopwords is here: <a class="instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file" title="stopwords.txt" href="https://northeastern.instructure.com/courses/27668/files/8723002?verifier=rSROnUSNPoIidbKqZB8qqLNg2vxxkypc2K0EJuDb&amp;wrap=1" target="_blank" data-canvas-previewable="false" data-api-endpoint="https://northeastern.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/27668/files/8723002" data-api-returntype="File">stopwords.txt.</a></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Once you have finished preparations, click “Apply” and wait a few minutes. <span>Because the program is going through each document and completing all the processes you selected, it needs some time. Then, you will see the final results of your preparation! </span><br></span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>You can also download your new processed corpus.</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://northeastern.instructure.com/courses/27668/files/8738331/preview?verifier=xEDjeHXGXzg1LCyzXvEhgkBZ6MYwcsr8qlso2nY4" alt="Lexos Prepare" width="640" height="327" data-api-endpoint="https://northeastern.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/27668/files/8738331" data-api-returntype="File" loading="lazy">&nbsp; </span><span><strong>Step 5.</strong> Visualize the pre-processed corpus or individual text using one of the three options.<br></span></p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Click “Visualize” and a drop-down of visualization choices will appear.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Click “Word Cloud” to visualize a word cloud across the entire corpus.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Click “Multi-Cloud” to visualize word clouds for each individual text.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>“Rolling Window” allows you to look at word trends across </span><strong>one </strong><span>document.</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://northeastern.instructure.com/courses/27668/files/8738640/preview?verifier=ow1Qdcgq1jyAZ7W9knyQ1J7NGPU7XCt3TedpvGDR" alt="Lexos Visualize" width="640" height="320" data-api-endpoint="https://northeastern.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/27668/files/8738640" data-api-returntype="File" loading="lazy"> &nbsp;</span><span><strong>Step 6.</strong> Analyze the corpus or single text using one or more of the analytical options. <span>Lexos offers a variety of tools to explore</span><span>. </span><br></span></p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li aria-level="2"><span>The “Analyze” tab provides a drop-down menu of more analytical options for analyzing your texts.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>This includes comparing texts through functions like “Top Words”, "Dendrograms", and “Similarity Query”.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span>Example: Rolling Windows Visualization</span></h3>
<p><span>Rolling Windows allow you to look at word trends across </span><strong>one</strong><span> document. To use a rolling window:</span></p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Go to “Visualize-&gt; Rolling Window” and type in a search term you want to visualize. You can also search multiple terms by clicking “String” and separating words with a comma (climate change, tax, jobs).</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Choose a Window size (the number of words each “window” contains). For shorter documents, it’s good to have a number like 300/500. For larger documents, you may want to make your window larger. Play around with the window size until you get a visualization that makes sense.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Click “Generate”.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://northeastern.instructure.com/courses/27668/files/8739128/preview?verifier=vZ41CY9H4rwoSW8IzkZwdqb7PWl0YIo1lzuhPPjz" alt="Lexos Rolling Windows" width="640" height="360" data-api-endpoint="https://northeastern.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/27668/files/8739128" data-api-returntype="File" loading="lazy">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Example: Dendrogram Analysis<br></span></h3>
<p><span>The dendrogram demonstrates similarities between the different documents. Dendrograms require at least two documents to compare. Dendrograms are able to show the hierarchy between objects. Dendrograms show:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Similarities between texts</span></li>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>The greater the distance between texts, the less similar they are</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>The smaller the distance between texts, the more similar they are</span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><span>For creating a dendrogram, select all the texts you wish to analyze using the "Manage" option and then go to "Analyze -&gt;Dendrogram".</span></p>
