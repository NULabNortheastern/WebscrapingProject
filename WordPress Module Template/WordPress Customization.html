<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customize Menu</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under “Appearance” you can click “Customize,” which is a bar on the left-hand side that shows you changes you can make across your site. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can get back to this “Customize” menu by clicking “Customize” on your Dashboard.**</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Site Menu</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have content, you want to make sure it is accessible to your intended audience. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the<strong> “Customize” </strong>section, go to “Menus,” which will allow you to add pages, posts, and other content to the overhead menus. You can even create dropdown menus by sliding one page under another page. (You can also get straight to the menu-editing section from the Dashboard by selecting "Menus" under the "Appearance" option in the section on the left.)</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Header</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your website, like all websites, should show off a “brand” of some kind. The </span><strong>header</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and subheader can help with this. The </span><strong>header</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the phrase/name that appears at the top of each webpage (the subheader, if applicable in your theme, appears below)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically, for professional websites, the header is your name, although some people choose more creative headers.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can find ways to change your header in <strong>“Site Identity”</strong> under the “<strong>Customize</strong>” section. </span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Widgets</span></h2>
<p><strong>Widgets</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on WordPress are small applications and components that appear on your WordPress site in specific areas across your website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, a “Footer” widget will appear at the bottom of your website across different pages. The widgets you put in “Sidebar” will appear in the sidebar. If you are creating a personal website, then you might attach your Twitter feed to your website, or a “Contact Me” section.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about what information you want to be presented to your audience, and where you want that information to be presented.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plugins</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Widgets, Plugins are ways to further customize your WordPress site. You can Google or use the Plugin search box to find Plugins that may be suitable for your needs. You'll find the link to edit Plugins on the left-hand side of both the Dashboard and the "My Home" views.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plugins are not available in the free version of WordPress (and, in fact, you don't need them to make an excellent site!), but we are mentioning them here for anyone who may be working with the paid version.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you do add plugins, make sure that they are well-reviewed and compatible with your theme and version of WordPress. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p><script src="https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145230000000000001/attachments/22977597/dp_app%20%25282%2529.js"></script>
