A </span>theme<span style="font-weight: 400;"> controls your WordPress site's appearance and functionality.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>In the left-hand column of your Dashboard,&nbsp; open up the “Appearance” menu, and then click the&nbsp; “Themes” button. </strong>The following image shows the 'Themes' page. (Reminder: if you need to get to the Dashboard from the "My Sites" page, click on "WP Admin" in the bottom left.)<strong><br></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take a few minutes to go through the themes and see which might appeal to you. Depending on the content of your website, each theme will offer strengths and weaknesses; themes provide descriptions of how they can be used. You can play around with the different options and see what will work for your website (you can change your mind later too, but know that this can dramatically change the appearance and functionality of your website). There are plenty of very effective free themes for you to choose from. </span><strong>Remember the context and audience of </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>this website, and choose a theme accordingly. </strong><a class="instructure_file_link inline_disabled" href="https://wordpress.org/themes/" target="_blank"></a></span><strong></strong></p>
