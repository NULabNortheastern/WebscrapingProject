<h3>Create a Collection</h3>
<p>You can have many collections within your Zotero library to keep track of various research projects. Collections should be titled to clearly reflect what class and/or research project they are for. To add a new collection, click the button on the upper left-hand corner of Zotero.</p>
<p>If you know the ISBN or DOI number of your source, you can add it to your collection by using the "Add Items by Identifier(s)" tool and pasting in the ISBN or DOI number. You can also upload your sources manually.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Inputting Information Manually</h3>
<ul>
<li><span>Select the “New Item” button and find the type of source the article is</span></li>
<li>Input as much of the bibliographic information as you can
<ul>
<li>Figure out the correct citation information</li>
<li>Determine the type of source</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use the “Notes” to keep track of important information (more on this soon)</li>
<li>Use the “tags” to create keywords. Do not overload yourself with keywords. They should be chosen with purpose to help you find similar content and organize your sources.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Drag and Drop PDFs for Biblio Data</h3>
<p><span>If you already have a PDF of an article downloaded, you can </span><strong>drag</strong><span> and </span><strong>drop</strong><span> the PDF to Zotero and it will automatically input all the information.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The PDF, however, needs to have metadata attached to it; not every PDF will automatically include metadata, but most you get from library databases should. If not, you can add the metadata manually.</span></p>
<h3><span>Zotero Chrome Extension</span></h3>
<p><span>If you use Chrome, there is a </span><strong>Zotero extension</strong><span> that you can download onto your browser and connect to your Zotero account. When you’re researching articles, you can easily save your bibliographic information by clicking on the “Zotero” button on your Chrome toolbar (just make sure it’s being saved to the correct library!). The Zotero button should be located on the upper right hand side of the Chrome toolbar. It will also save the HTML link or the PDF.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Always double check that the citation information is correct in your Zotero library. </strong>S<span>ome websites do not provide proper metadata, so this is an important step.</span></p>
<h3><span>Zotero on Google Docs and Word</span></h3>
<p><span>Your Zotero can now be connected to your Google Drive account or Microsoft Word. While you are writing a paper, you can use the Zotero plugin to create your bibliography!</span></p>
<p><strong>Always double-check that all the bibliographic information is correct and follows the proper citation format.</strong></p>
<h3>Exporting your Bibliography</h3>
<p>You have several options for exporting your bibliography:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>As a bibliography saved directly into your clipboard</span></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Right-click your library</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Click “Create bibliography from collection”</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Choose your citation format</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Paste the bibliography into your works cited page</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><span>As a CSV file (which can be opened on Excel) if you’re ever interested</span></li>
<li>Export it to other Citation Management software (EndNotes, for example)</li>
