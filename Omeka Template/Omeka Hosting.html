Trials have a limited number of themes and plugins, but use the same Omeka Classic code, so you can get a sense of how the platform works. There is no time limit to trials.</span></p>
<p><strong>Reclaim Hosting</strong><span>, used by many academics, is another option for hosting. It is an inexpensive way to get web hosting with an included domain registration.</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Once you have purchased a plan through </span><a href="http://reclaimhosting.com"><span>reclaimhosting.com</span></a><span>, you have access to a wide range of applications, including Omeka</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Hosting Omeka yourself lets you install more themes and plugins than even the most expensive </span><a href="http://omeka.net"><span>omeka.net</span></a><span> plan</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>To <strong>add Omeka to your Reclaim-hosted site</strong>, log in and go to the cPanel, then select Omeka under the "Applications" section. From there you can install Omeka with the "Installatron."&nbsp;</span></p>
