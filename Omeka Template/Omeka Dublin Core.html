It was created to reject siloed cultural memory and enable radically open cultural heritage data. Dublin Core <span>is a set of fifteen "core" elements for describing resources.&nbsp;</span>It is designed to be simple and flexible, which has both advantages and disadvantages. You can learn more about working with Dublin Core <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Content/Working_with_Dublin_Core/" target="_blank">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>Fun fact: it was named after Dublin, Ohio, not Dublin, Ireland!</p>
<h3><span>Best Practices</span></h3>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>All the fields are optional, so you can choose which you want to use to describe the items in your archive; be strategic about which fields you select!</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>It is essential to have consistency in metadata fields across your items: both in which you select and in how you fill those in. For instance, you don't want to have "Firstname Lastname" in half your "creator" fields and "Lastname, Firstname" in the other half.&nbsp;</span></li>
