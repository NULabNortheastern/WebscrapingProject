<p><span>Omeka is a web publishing platform for data-rich items, exhibits, and collections. </span><span>It was developed by the Center for History and New Media at George Mason University, who endearingly describe it as</span><span> “WordPress for Museums”. It has been designed with scholars, librarians, educators, and archivists in mind.</span></p>
<p><span>Omeka emphasizes the role of metadata in archiving and curation. It&nbsp;</span><span>offers the ability to contextualize items &amp; bring them in conversation with one another.&nbsp;</span><span>It also makes it easy to create and update metadata using Dublin Core standards. [Dublin Core will be explained later in this module]</span></p>
<p><span><span>Note</span><span> that Omeka has three versions: Omeka S, Omeka classic, and Omeka.net. For purpose of this module, you will be learning and using the free trial version of Omeka.net, which does not expire. It is the best choice for smaller Omeka projects or projects that can be finished over the course of a semester. </span></span><span><span>This free trial version of Omeka.net lets you create a single website, allows </span></span>500 MB of <span><span>s</span></span>torage, provides access to&nbsp;8 Plugins and 2 Themes.</p>
<p>Here is the Omeka.net website: <a href="https://www.omeka.net/" target="_blank">https://www.omeka.net/</a>.&nbsp; Example websites can be explored in the <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://info.omeka.net/showcase/" target="_blank">Showcase</a> section.</p><script src="https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145230000000000001/attachments/22977597/dp_app%20%25282%2529.js"></script>
