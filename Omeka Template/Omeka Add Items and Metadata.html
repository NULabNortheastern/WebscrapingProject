<h3><span>Adding Items</span></h3>
<p><span>Items represent various digital (or digitized) media types such as documents, photographs, and audio or video files which are uploaded and described by website creators. Items are the building blocks in Omeka. </span></p>
<p>To build a digital collections website, you must first add items.<span>&nbsp;Items can belong to a collection, be tagged with many keywords, and used in multiple exhibits.</span></p>
<p><span>To add an item, go u</span><span>nder the “Items” tab in the navigation bar, click “Add an Item”.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>You can upload multiple files for one item</span></li>
<li><span>You can choose whether to make an item public or not</span></li>
<li><span>You can edit items once they are added.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span>Add an Item takes you to the admin/items/add page where you see a navigation bar across the top pointing you to different stages of adding an item. The first tab shows the<strong>&nbsp;Dublin Core</strong>&nbsp;fields which are available for every item in the archive. The&nbsp;<strong>Item Type Metadata</strong>&nbsp;tab lets you choose a specific item type for the object you are adding. The&nbsp;<strong>Files</strong>&nbsp;tab lets you upload files to an item. The&nbsp;<strong>Tags</strong>&nbsp;tab allows you to add keyword tags to your item.</span></span></p>

<h3><span>Adding Metadata</span></h3>
<p><span><span>An Item contains metadata or descriptive data about a specific object. </span>It is information about the object itself such as the title, the date published, the medium, the format, and so on. Omeka provides the option to add metadata in two forms: Dublin Core standards and Item Type.</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Dublin Core vs. Item Type Metadata</span></li>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Dublin Core is the basic information </span><span>that will be relevant </span><strong>across items</strong></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Item Type Metadata is additional </span><span>information that is likely to be </span><strong>relevant for specific item types</strong><span> (e.g. duration for moving images, or subject line for emails)</span></li>
</ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>You can add additional input fields for both types of metadata</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>For formatting text in metadata fields</span></li>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>If you click "Use HTML" you will get more formatting options</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>You can also enter basic HTML to make formatting edits that are not available in the default editor; for more information on the HTML editor, visit </span><a href="https://info.omeka.net/build-a-website/use-the-html-editor/"><span>this page</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></li>
