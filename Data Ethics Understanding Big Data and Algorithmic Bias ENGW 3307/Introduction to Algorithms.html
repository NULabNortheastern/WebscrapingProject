Computers are given input, then they follow <strong>the set of rules or the algorithm</strong> which leads to the output, or the result. </span></p>
<p>Coders can create highly complex and sophisticated algorithms, however, the fundaments are quite straightforward. An algorithm is a series of actions or rules that achieve the desired goal. Every person works with elementary algorithms every day. We all follow a set of pre-defined actions or rules to achieve a desired result. For example, think about the specific steps you follow to make coffee. That's also an algorithm! Algorithms are everywhere, and most people don't realize it. They're just a set of rules or steps that get done over and over again (very quickly, if done on a computer).</p>
