<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big data </span><strong>sources</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> include: digitized records, social media/internet activity, and sensors from the physical environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example: If you have </span><strong>location services</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> turned on for Google (if you use Google maps), Google can track your every move. Go to:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you care about your privacy, anonymity, and control of your information and you are interested in DIY cybersecurity, follow these guidelines!&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ownership and control </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big data is often </span><strong>privately owned or beyond oversight</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big data is often privately owned by corporations or governments and is frequently traded and sold between vendors, collectors, advertisers, and the government. And so, <strong>our information is the product that is being traded </strong>by businesses. For example, we may think we are using the apps and websites for free; however, we are giving the app and website owners our data, which they use to generate advertisement revenue. H</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ave you ever received targeted advertisements? For example, you searched for a new mattress and looked at few reviews on YouTube. Soon your Facebook, YouTube, and other platforms will start showing you ads for mattresses! This happens because companies purchase activity data from YouTube/Instagram/Facebook etc. to determine who their target players might be, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">they have categorized you as a potential customer.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bias </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big data can often reproduce results that may <strong>harm</strong> certain communities and identities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Amazon’s algorithm for hiring employees in 2018 reflected the historical male domination in tech companies. The algorithm taught itself to interpret any mention of “women” in the new resumes as negative and rejected these applications.</span></p>
