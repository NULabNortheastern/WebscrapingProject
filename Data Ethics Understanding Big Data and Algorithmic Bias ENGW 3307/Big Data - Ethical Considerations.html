<p>Because of all this, it is important to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How are we being represented online?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How are our data being used?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who is using our data and for what purposes?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How might our data be used in the future?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watch this <a class="instructure_file_link inline_disabled external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji18sDbWI_k&amp;ab_channel=TheGuardian" target="_blank"><span>brief video</span><span class="screenreader-only">&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</span></a> from The Guardian, of the author and broadcaster Timandra Harkness, and think about the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>How are experts and researchers using big data in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic? Have you read any article that shared results from a big data analysis? What different types of data or dimensions did the article use? Was it really "big data" or was it just large data?</li>
<li>Are large-scale monitoring and surveillance systems a breach of individuals' privacy? In a pandemic, is the tradeoff between (some level of) privacy and the health/safety of a community/nation worth considering?</li>
</ul>
