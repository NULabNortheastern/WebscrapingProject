<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">Word cloud of Wikipedia page on 'Big Data'</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big data, or even data in general, has been called <strong>the ‘new oil’</strong> by some. When you control how data is collected, processed, categorized, stored, and used, you have a great deal of power. You can help choose what information is shared, with whom, and how. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a class="instructure_file_link inline_disabled" href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/04/shoshana-zuboff-surveillance-capitalism-assault-human-automomy-digital-privacy" target="_blank">Shoshana Zuboff</a> argues that we live in an era of surveillance capitalism: our information is a product that is monitored and sold by companies. The more companies can survey our choices, actions, and patterns, the more they can categorize us, sell information about us, and profit from that information.&nbsp;<br></span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Definition</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have probably all heard the term “big data,” but what is it really and how do we define it?<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies, governments, and other groups collect large amounts of data (“big data”) from vast amounts of users and analyze this data quickly for a range of purposes (advertising, surveillance, enhancing search results, etc). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal of collecting and processing this data is to predict individual user behavior based on patterns from the user as well as patterns from “similar” users (in terms of demographic information, behavioral patterns, etc).</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big Data Sources</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big data comes from many different sources. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These include digitized records, social media and internet activity, and sensors from the physical environment, to name only a few examples.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big data is often privately owned by corporations or governments and is frequently traded and sold between vendors, collectors, advertisers, and the government. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, insurance companies often purchase data from other collectors like social media providers to collect data on customers in order to make insurance sales decisions.<br></span></p><script src="https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_145230000000000001/attachments/22977597/dp_app%20%25282%2529.js"></script>
