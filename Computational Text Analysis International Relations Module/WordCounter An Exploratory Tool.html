<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Word counter by databasic.io is a <strong>user-friendly basic word counting tool. </strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It allows you to <strong>count words, bigrams, and trigrams </strong>in plain text files and to download spreadsheets with the results. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The maximum file size that can be uploaded is 10MB, and .txt., .docx, and .rtf are the acceptable file formats for this tool.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Step-by-Step Guide for using WordCounter:</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Go to the Wordcounter Link <a href="https://databasic.io/en/wordcounter/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://databasic.io/en/wordcounter/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Option 1 - Click the 'paste text' tab, copy the text from the .txt file from the corpus and paste it in the space provided.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Option 2 - Click the 'upload a file' tab and upload a file.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select or deselect the two options: 'ignore lower case' and 'ignore stopwords' based on your needs.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click the 'COUNT' button.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: </strong>Review the results</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you look at your results, you’ll see a word cloud of the most common terms, as well as three lists of the most common single words, bigrams, and trigrams.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mouse over the words in the word cloud to see their counts relative to the total words in the document.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can download your results with the links in the second paragraph under “What do I do next?”&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A few notes:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">By default, the WordCounter will lowercase all the words in your input file, and will also apply a stop words list (that is, a list of the words that tend to be very common across many documents in a particular language). You can turn these options on and off.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because this is a very basic tool, it does not allow you to edit the stop words, but more robust analysis platforms do allow for customization of stop words lists. Try counting the words in a document both with and without stop words to see how these change your results.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lowercasing the input text is another common question for text analysis projects; it is usually most helpful to treat both capitalized and lowercase versions of a word as the same token. However, this does tend to lose some nuance—think about the difference between Polish and polish. </span></li>
