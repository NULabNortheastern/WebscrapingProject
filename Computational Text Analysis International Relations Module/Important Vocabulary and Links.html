<ul>
<li>
<strong>Computational Text Analysis</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Text analysis is making inferences based on textual data. Computational text analysis (CTA) involves a computer drawing out patterns in a text, and a researcher interpreting those patterns. CTA includes methods such as word count frequency, nGrams, and sentiment analysis. CTA is similar to statistical analysis, but the data are texts.&nbsp;</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Corpus (plural–corpora)</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: A collection of texts used for analysis and research purposes. Example: One could create a corpus of all of Barack Obama’s presidential speeches to trace his language over the course of his presidency.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Stop words</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: words that appear frequently in a language, like pronouns, prepositions, and basic verbs. These are often removed for computational analysis. Some English stop words include: a, the, she, he, I, me, us, of, is, would, could, should, etc.&nbsp;</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Word Count Frequency:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Counting the total times a word appears in a text/corpus or the percentage of how often it appears.</span>
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>nGram:</strong> A continuous sequence of n items in a text. For example, in Barack Obama’s speeches, a bigram (or 2 continuous words) could be ‘United States,’ while a trigram (3 words) could be ‘yes we can.’</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Sentiment Analysis</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Measuring the sentiment of a text based on a scale such as negative/positive or happy/sad. Each word has a particular weight to determine where on the scale it falls, and these weights are calculated to determine a text’s overall sentiment.</span>
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Plain Text File: </strong>A plain text file is one that does not include any all hidden formatting. A very common and useful kind of plain text file is <strong>.txt</strong>. You can create .txt files by using plain text editors such as NotePad on Windows or TextEdit on Macs. We recommend saving your texts as plain text files when doing computational text analysis.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Data Preparation: </strong>Textual data can contain letters, numbers, punctuation, white space, and special characters. Most of the web-browser text analysis tools will do data preparation work for you, including removing stop words, punctuation, and unnecessary white space.</span></li>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Metadata: </strong>Data about your data, such as information about the individual texts in your corups. Metadata about texts may include: t</span><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">itle of the text, a</span><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">uthor of the text, w</span><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">here the text was published, w</span><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">hen the text was published, a</span><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;"> URL of the place where you got the text file originally, t</span><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">he name of the .txt file, etc.</span>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Web-Browser Computational Text Analysis Tools</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These browser-based GUI (Graphical User Interface) text analysis tools are not particularly powerful or sophisticated, but they can show word frequencies and patterns in language. While using coding languages like Python and R can open up other types of analysis (such as word embedding models and topic modeling), these GUI tools allow you to do more basic analysis to begin examining your texts computationally.&nbsp; We will be working with:</span></p>
