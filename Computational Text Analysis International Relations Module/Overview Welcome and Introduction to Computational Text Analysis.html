<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introduction to Computational Text Analysis</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Computational text analysis refers to an array of methods that can be used to “read” texts with a computer. This form of analysis can range from basic word frequency counts to more advanced techniques like machine learning. Text analysis is often used on a corpus, or a collection of multiple texts, and provides a glimpse into patterns across the texts. Some people also perform text analysis on larger individual documents, like novels or autobiographies.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why?</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Computational text analysis can help us <strong>analyze very large amounts of data</strong> and <strong>discover </strong></span><strong>patterns</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> in texts</strong>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Particular disciplines care <strong>deeply</strong> about the language used and how this language may reach intended audiences. Text analysis provides another method for approaching these discourses.</span></p>
<h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">How</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span>
</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Computational text analysis can be conducted using web-based tools or coding languages like Python and R. Many web-based t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ools are open-access and usually free as long as you have access to a computer and the internet. These tools have limits on how much data they can handle but are usually useful for small projects. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of these include Voyant, Data Basic.io tools, and Jason Davies’ Word Tree tool. </span></p>

<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<p><span>By the end of this module, you should be able to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understand &nbsp;basic vocabulary around doing text analysis, such as "corpus" and "stop words"</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Build a small textual corpus and prepare the text for analysis</span></li>
<li>Use a variety of web-based tools for text analysis and interpret the results</li>
