The demonstration videos will show how to prepare this data for text analysis so you should refer to those for instruction when you are ready to build your own corpus. The section below discusses overall best practices in building a textual corpus.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p><strong>How to Build a Corpus</strong></p>
<p><span>When building a corpus, especially for a smaller project, follow these three steps.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Choose the texts or text selections that you would like to include.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Remember, these texts are not necessarily representative of a larger body of writing. </span><span>The argument and analysis you're making depend upon the context that you bring to the collection you've selected. Consider any limitations in the corpus's ability to represent the questions your project is seeking to answer. For this project, you will be selecting from the "Measure" column in the WTO dataset, but you might also want to build several sub-corpora of selected countries based on region or other features you want to compare.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. Create a folder on your computer or cloud storage where you will store your corpus. You might title this folder “international_relations_corpus”.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Once you have chosen the texts you will include, open a plain text editor (for example, Notepad on PCs and TextEdit on Macs). Copy and paste the contents of each document or data selection into the text editor, and save as a .txt file with a descriptive file name.</span></p>
<p><strong>Repeat steps 1 through 3 for each text in the corpus.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Helpful tips:</strong></p>

<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><span>TextEdit on Macs: You must make sure it is configured to work with plain text files. To do this, open Text Edit and go to “Format" and select "Make Plain Text." If you want to configure Text Edit to treat all files as plain text, go to "Preferences," look under the "Format" section, and choose "Plain text." Then, restart TextEdit.</span></li>
<li>
<span>Only copy one text into each new plain text file.&nbsp;</span>Make sure not to put any spaces in the names of the files as you save them. Use underscores or hyphens to mark spaces between words instead.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
