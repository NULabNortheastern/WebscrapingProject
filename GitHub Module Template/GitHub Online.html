<ol>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Be sure that you’re logged into your GitHub account.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>From your repository, navigate into the appropriate folder you need to add materials to, or edit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>You can drag and drop PDF or markdown files directly from your computer into the file by clicking the “add file” dropdown menu in the upper right corner of the window and selecting “upload file.”&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
