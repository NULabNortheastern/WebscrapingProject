<p><strong>For personal repositories, there are two types of roles.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Owner: </strong><span>the person the repository belongs to; each repository can have only one owner</span><strong style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li><strong style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-size: 1rem;">Collaborator: </strong><span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-size: 1rem;">someone that the repository owner has granted access to so that they can make changes to the repository</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When a repository is used for an organization, there are various roles with varying credentials.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>You can invite people to collaborate on organizational repositories with a broader set of permissions, including </span><strong>reading</strong><span>, </span><strong>writing</strong><span>, and </span><strong>admin</strong><span>. </span></li>
<li><span>You can also invite people to join the organizations themselves as </span><strong>owners</strong><span> (here, there can be more than one) or </span><strong>members</strong><span>.&nbsp;</span></li>
