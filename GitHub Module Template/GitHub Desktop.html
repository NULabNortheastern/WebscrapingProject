<p><span>First, you need to install GitHub Desktop and then connect your local computer to the cloud repository. In order to do this, in the “File” menu, click “Clone a Repository” and then use your repository’s URL.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to make changes (editing, uploading, deleting, etc.) to GitHub:</span></p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1"><span>You </span><strong>MUST</strong> <strong>CLICK</strong><span> “Fetch Origin”/”Pull” every time you want to make any edits, even if it’s a small one. This way, your local version is up-to-date with the cloud version. Otherwise, there could be GitHub conflicts.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Make your edits on your local files/folders, whether that’s editing a README file, adding a new PDF, &amp;c.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>When you want to upload your new files/folders into the cloud repository:</span></li>
<ol>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Make sure the edited files are selected in the browser view on the left (if you’re on a Mac, unclick anything with DS_Store)</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Write a brief summary of what you are changing&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Click “commit to master”</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Click “</span><strong>Push,</strong><span>” and voila, it should be on GitHub! You can look for your changes in GitHub on your browser to be sure.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
